create all lesson that are not at completed status from @lesson_ideas.csv, one by one, use @UNIVERSAL_LESSON_PROMPT.md as your system prompt.

validate that each lesson compliance with the following rules
### Lesson Format Requirements

All lessons MUST have:
- `lesson_id`: Valid UUID (use uuid.uuid4())
- `domain`: One of the 9 domains
- `title`: Clear, descriptive title
- `difficulty`: 1-3 (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
- `order_index`: Position in domain sequence
- `prerequisites`: List[str] of lesson_id UUIDs (empty array if none)
- `concepts`: List of key concepts covered
- `estimated_time`: Minutes to complete
- `learning_objectives`: List of learning goals
- `post_assessment`: List of assessment questions
- `jim_kwik_principles`: List of learning principles applied
- `content_blocks`: List of content sections

### Valid Content Block Types

Only use these content block types (ContentType enum):
- `explanation` - Core concept explanations
- `video` - Video content (URL or embedded)
- `diagram` - Visual diagrams
- `quiz` - Interactive quizzes
- `simulation` - Hands-on simulations
- `reflection` - Reflection questions
- `memory_aid` - Mnemonics and memory techniques
- `real_world` - Real-world applications
- `code_exercise` - Code examples and exercises
- `mindset_coach` - Motivational coaching sections

**Do NOT use**: concept_deep_dive, real_world_application, step_by_step_guide, common_pitfalls, actionable_takeaways (these are invalid and will cause validation errors)
