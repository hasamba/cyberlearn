        "text": "### Google Earth Pro\nThe emphasis on google earth pro within Satellite Imagery and Geospatial Intelligence connects directly to frontline needs across the osint domain. Practitioners lean on Maltego because Maltego visualizes relationships across domains, emails, social media, and infrastructure using transform plugins. OSINT analysts chain transforms to map attacker infrastructure, corporate relationships, and leaked credentials.\nKey telemetry such as DNS and certificate transparency surfaces the signals teams must investigate. DNS history and certificate logs reveal subdomains, infrastructure changes, and new deployments. OSINT practitioners track attacker infrastructure, monitor brand abuse, and feed detections.\nAdversaries repeatedly weaponize Doxxing. Threat actors compile public and breached data to expose individuals. Monitor breach forums, social media, and paste sites for leaked information to coordinate takedowns.\nHistorical lessons from 2014 Sony phishing underline the stakes. Attackers used public data to spear-phish executives, leading to catastrophic breaches. Regular OSINT reviews and awareness reduce social engineering success.\nCommon mistake: Failing to validate data sources introduces bias and misinformation into investigations.\n\n#### Operational guidance\nTranslate google earth pro into practice by running scenario-based drills and documenting expected versus observed telemetry. Document every data source, time, and method to maintain chain of custody.\n\n### Sentinel Hub\nThe emphasis on sentinel hub within Satellite Imagery and Geospatial Intelligence connects directly to frontline needs across the osint domain. Practitioners lean on SpiderFoot because SpiderFoot automates reconnaissance across hundreds of data sources, gathering threat intelligence artifacts. Investigators configure modules to collect WHOIS, DNS, breach data, and dark web mentions, then review risk scores.\nKey telemetry such as Social media activity surfaces the signals teams must investigate. Public posts on Twitter, LinkedIn, and GitHub surface employee details and attacker chatter. Analysts assess social engineering exposure and identify adversary recruitment or bragging.\nAdversaries repeatedly weaponize Infrastructure pivoting. Adversaries leverage OSINT to identify vulnerable third parties or supply chain targets. Track certificate transparency, domain registrations, and Git repositories for signs of staging.\nHistorical lessons from APT infrastructure discovery underline the stakes. Researchers used OSINT to map Fancy Bear domains and certificates, informing global defenses. Open-source investigations empower defenders to preempt attacker campaigns.\nCommon mistake: Neglecting privacy and legal considerations risks violating regulations.\n\n#### Operational guidance\nTranslate sentinel hub into practice by running scenario-based drills and documenting expected versus observed telemetry. Use VPNs and sock puppets to avoid tipping off targets during reconnaissance.\n\n### Planet Labs\nThe emphasis on planet labs within Satellite Imagery and Geospatial Intelligence connects directly to frontline needs across the osint domain. Practitioners lean on Recon-ng because Recon-ng provides a modular framework for reconnaissance with API integrations and reporting. Researchers build workspaces, add modules for certificates, GitHub, and Shodan, and export findings to share with defenders.\nKey telemetry such as Breach repositories surfaces the signals teams must investigate. Collections such as Have I Been Pwned reveal compromised credentials and personal data. Security teams notify affected users, enforce password resets, and monitor for targeted phishing.\nAdversaries repeatedly weaponize Social engineering. Attackers study employee profiles to craft convincing phishing or voice scams. Educate staff about oversharing and monitor for targeted spear-phishing attempts.\nHistorical lessons from Deepfake scams underline the stakes. Executives were targeted with AI-generated audio leveraging publicly available voice samples. Monitoring for brand impersonation and training staff on verification prevents fraud.\nCommon mistake: Working alone without peer review increases the chance of misattribution.\n\n#### Operational guidance\nTranslate planet labs into practice by running scenario-based drills and documenting expected versus observed telemetry. Correlate findings across multiple sources before drawing conclusions.\n\n### historical imagery analysis\nThe emphasis on historical imagery analysis within Satellite Imagery and Geospatial Intelligence connects directly to frontline needs across the osint domain. Practitioners lean on IntelTechniques tools because IntelTechniques offers curated search utilities for people, social media, and public records. Analysts cross-reference names with social platforms, property records, and breach data to build profiles.\nKey telemetry such as Geospatial imagery surfaces the signals teams must investigate. Satellite and street-level imagery help analyze physical locations, infrastructure, and logistic routes. Investigators verify facility layouts, supply chain nodes, and conflict zones.\nAdversaries repeatedly weaponize Doxxing. Threat actors compile public and breached data to expose individuals.
