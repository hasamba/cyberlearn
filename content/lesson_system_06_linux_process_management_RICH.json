        "text": "# Linux Process Lifecycle\n\n## Process Creation: The Fork-Exec Model\n\nLinux creates processes using a two-step approach:\n\n### Step 1: fork() - Clone the Parent\n```c\npid_t child_pid = fork();\n\nWhat happens:\n1. Kernel creates exact copy of parent process\n2. Child gets new PID\n3. Child inherits:\n   - Memory space (copy-on-write)\n   - File descriptors\n   - Environment variables\n   - Current working directory\n   - UID/GID (user/group identity)\n```\n\n### Step 2: exec() - Replace with New Program\n```c\nexecve(\"/bin/bash\", args, env);\n\nWhat happens:\n1. Replaces current process image with new program\n2. Keeps same PID\n3. Resets memory but keeps:\n   - PID\n   - PPID (parent PID)\n   - Open file descriptors (unless FD_CLOEXEC)\n   - UID/GID\n```\n\n## Process Hierarchy Visualization\n\n```\n         systemd (PID 1)\n              |\n      ┌───────┴───────────────┐\n      │                       │\n   sshd (PID 500)      NetworkManager (PID 600)\n      │\n   sshd (PID 1234) ← Your SSH session\n      │\n   bash (PID 1235)\n      │\n   ┌──┴──┐\n   │     │\n  ps    vim\n (1300) (1301)\n```\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n- **PPID (Parent PID)**: Every process has a parent (except PID 1)\n- **Orphan Process**: If parent dies, child is re-parented to PID 1\n- **Zombie Process**: Child finished but parent hasn't called wait() yet\n- **Process Group**: Collection of processes (job control in shells)\n- **Session**: Collection of process groups (terminal session)"

Incident Response Scenario\n\n**You run `lsof | grep deleted` and find:**\n```\nsupd  15234  www-data  txt  /tmp/.supd (deleted)\n```\n\n**Questions:**\n1. What does this indicate?\n2. What commands would you run next to investigate?\n3. How would you safely terminate and preserve evidence?\n\n**Your Investigation Plan:**\n___________________________________________\n___________________________________________\n\n---\n\n## 3. Signal Handling Decision\n\n**Scenario:** A service is misbehaving and needs to be stopped.\n\n**Question:** When should you use `kill -15` vs `kill -9`? What's the risk of using `-9` first?\n\n**Your Answer:**\n___________________________________________\n___________________________________________\n\n---\n\n## 4. Process State Analysis\n\n**You see a process in 'D' state (uninterruptible sleep) for 10+ minutes.**\n\n**Questions:**\n- Is this normal?\n- What could cause this?\n- Can you kill it with `kill -9`?\n- What should you investigate?\n\n---\n\n## 5. Forensic Analysis Challenge\n\n**During an investigation, you find:**\n```bash\nps aux | grep suspicious\nroot  9999  95.0  2.0  12345  8000 ?  R  00:00  120:00 [kworker/u:1]\n```\n\n**Red Flags to Identify:**\n1. ___________________________________\n2. ___________________________________\n3. ___________________________________\n\n**What makes this suspicious?**\n[Hint: Look at PID, CPU%, brackets, name similarity to real kernel threads]\n\n---\n\n## 6. Connect Your Knowledge\n\n**How do process concepts connect to:**\n- **Windows Services** (previous lesson)?\n- **Container Security** (upcoming topic)?\n- **Privilege Escalation**?\n\nWrite 2-3 connections you see:\n___________________________________________\n___________________________________________"
