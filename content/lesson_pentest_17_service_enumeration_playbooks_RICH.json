Execute targeted enumeration steps (e.g., SMB share listing, HTTP tech fingerprinting, SMTP VRFY) and log results with timestamps.\n4. Package findings plus next-step recommendations in a handoff document for the exploitation team.\n\nCapture artefacts as you go so the reporting section writes itself."
