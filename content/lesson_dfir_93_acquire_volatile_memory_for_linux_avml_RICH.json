        "text": "### AVML for memory acquisition\nThe emphasis on avml for memory acquisition within Acquire Volatile Memory for Linux (AVML) connects directly to frontline needs across the dfir domain. Practitioners lean on Volatility 3 because Volatility parses memory images to extract processes, network connections, DLLs, and registry hives for incident response. Forensic analysts build custom plugins, analyze userland injections, and compare baseline memory profiles to detect anomalies.\nKey telemetry such as Windows event logs surfaces the signals teams must investigate. Security, System, and Application logs reveal credential abuse, persistence, and lateral movement indicators. Investigators parse EVTX files, highlight Event IDs 4624, 4688, 7045, and map activity to MITRE ATT&CK techniques.\nAdversaries repeatedly weaponize Ransomware triage. Responders must identify initial access vectors, enumerate encrypted hosts, and preserve artifacts before cleanup. Analyze ransom notes, examine scheduled tasks or services, and trace command history for staging scripts.\nHistorical lessons from Sony Pictures attack underline the stakes. Destructive wiper malware disabled systems, leaked data, and disrupted operations. DFIR teams validated backups, reconstructed wiper execution paths, and hardened network segmentation.\nCommon mistake: Failing to capture volatile memory before powering down systems destroys critical evidence.\n\n#### Operational guidance\nTranslate avml for memory acquisition into practice by running scenario-based drills and documenting expected versus observed telemetry. Validate hash values immediately after evidence acquisition to ensure integrity during transfer.\n\n### LiME (Linux Memory Extractor)\nThe emphasis on lime (linux memory extractor) within Acquire Volatile Memory for Linux (AVML) connects directly to frontline needs across the dfir domain. Practitioners lean on Plaso / log2timeline because Plaso processes diverse log sources to create unified forensic timelines for Windows, Linux, and macOS systems. Responders feed artifacts into Plaso, query super timelines, and correlate execution, file access, and network events.\nKey telemetry such as NTFS metadata surfaces the signals teams must investigate. Master File Table entries, USN journal records, and $LogFile entries provide file system activity timelines. Analysts reconstruct file creation and deletion, recover timestamps, and detect timestomping attempts.\nAdversaries repeatedly weaponize Advanced persistent threat foothold. APT actors deploy stealthy implants, modify registry run keys, and abuse legitimate tools for persistence. Hunt for anomalous WMI persistence, unusual DLL search order hijacking, and network beacons in memory dumps.\nHistorical lessons from Target POS breach underline the stakes. Attackers installed memory scraping malware on point-of-sale systems to steal card data. Investigators examined memory images, network traffic, and vendor remote access to remediate.\nCommon mistake: Not documenting chain of custody makes findings inadmissible and undermines trust with legal teams.\n\n#### Operational guidance\nTranslate lime (linux memory extractor) into practice by running scenario-based drills and documenting expected versus observed telemetry. Use a forensic workstation isolated from production networks to avoid contaminating evidence.\n\n### /proc/kcore vs dedicated tools\nThe emphasis on /proc/kcore vs dedicated tools within Acquire Volatile Memory for Linux (AVML) connects directly to frontline needs across the dfir domain. Practitioners lean on Velociraptor because Velociraptor collects forensic artifacts at scale with VQL queries across endpoints. Incident handlers deploy hunts, collect targeted registry keys, Master File Table entries, and process creation logs, then stream results for analysis.\nKey telemetry such as Prefetch and Shimcache surfaces the signals teams must investigate. Application execution artifacts highlight first-run timestamps and execution frequency. Responders compare prefetch metadata with malware dropper timelines to confirm execution sequences.\nAdversaries repeatedly weaponize Insider data theft. Insiders copy intellectual property to removable media or cloud storage, often after-hours. Review USB device history, shellbags, and browser cache records; correlate with VPN and proxy logs.\nHistorical lessons from Trisis/Triconex incident underline the stakes. Malware targeted industrial safety systems, manipulating controllers and forcing shutdowns. Responders collected engineering workstation forensics, reviewed ICS network captures, and coordinated with OT teams.\nCommon mistake: Relying solely on antivirus detections overlooks manual artifacts like command history or registry changes.\n\n#### Operational guidance\nTranslate /proc/kcore vs dedicated tools into practice by running scenario-based drills and documenting expected versus observed telemetry. Cross-reference multiple artifact families (logs, registry, memory) to confirm hypotheses and reduce false positives.\n\n### memory image formats (raw\nThe emphasis on memory image formats (raw within Acquire Volatile Memory for Linux (AVML) connects directly to frontline needs across the dfir domain. Practitioners lean on Kape because Kroll Artifact Parser and Extractor automates artifact collection and parsing on compromised systems. DFIR teams orchestrate targeted triage packages, extract browser data, jump lists, and SRUM artifacts to accelerate investigations.\nKey telemetry such as Network packet captures surfaces the signals teams must investigate. PCAPs capture command-and-control communications, data exfiltration, and lateral movement protocols. DFIR teams carve HTTP payloads, reconstruct TLS sessions, and extract IOCs for containment actions.\nAdversaries repeatedly weaponize Ransomware triage.
