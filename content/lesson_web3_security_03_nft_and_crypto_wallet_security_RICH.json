        "text": "### Wallet types (hot vs cold)\nThe emphasis on wallet types (hot vs cold) within NFT and Crypto Wallet Security connects directly to frontline needs across the web3 security domain. Practitioners lean on Slither because Slither performs static analysis of Solidity smart contracts to flag vulnerabilities. Security auditors integrate Slither into CI to catch reentrancy, access control, and arithmetic issues.\nKey telemetry such as On-chain transaction data surfaces the signals teams must investigate. Blockchain explorers expose transaction traces, contract calls, and state changes. Analysts inspect transaction graphs to spot exploit patterns, flash loans, and fund flows.\nAdversaries repeatedly weaponize Reentrancy. Reentrancy allows attackers to repeatedly call functions before state updates. Use reentrancy guards, checks-effects-interactions pattern, and audit call flows.\nHistorical lessons from DAO hack underline the stakes. The 2016 DAO exploit drained millions of Ether via recursive calls. Prompted the Ethereum hard fork and established secure development practices.\nCommon mistake: Smart contracts are immutable once deployed; unpatched flaws persist on-chain.\n\n#### Operational guidance\nTranslate wallet types (hot vs cold) into practice by running scenario-based drills and documenting expected versus observed telemetry. Implement upgradeable proxies with rigorous access controls and timelocks.\n\n### seed phrase security\nThe emphasis on seed phrase security within NFT and Crypto Wallet Security connects directly to frontline needs across the web3 security domain. Practitioners lean on Foundry because Foundry provides fast smart contract development, fuzzing, and testing toolchains. Engineers write invariant tests, fuzz inputs, and simulate upgrades to validate contract logic.\nKey telemetry such as Event logs surfaces the signals teams must investigate. Smart contracts emit events capturing transfers, swaps, and administrative actions. Security engineers monitor events for abnormal withdrawals or parameter changes.\nAdversaries repeatedly weaponize Price oracle manipulation. Attackers manipulate oracle prices to drain lending pools or trigger liquidations. Monitor price deviations, enforce time-weighted oracles, and detect flash loan spikes.\nHistorical lessons from Poly Network breach underline the stakes. Cross-chain bridge flaws allowed attackers to steal $600M before funds were returned. Highlighted the importance of multi-sig governance, auditing, and emergency response playbooks.\nCommon mistake: Decentralized governance introduces social attack vectors.\n\n#### Operational guidance\nTranslate seed phrase security into practice by running scenario-based drills and documenting expected versus observed telemetry. Design emergency pause mechanisms (circuit breakers) for critical contracts.\n\n### phishing attacks\nThe emphasis on phishing attacks within NFT and Crypto Wallet Security connects directly to frontline needs across the web3 security domain. Practitioners lean on MythX / Mythril because MythX/Mythril analyze smart contracts using symbolic execution and security checks. Auditors run Mythril to detect integer overflow, unchecked calls, and dangerous patterns.\nKey telemetry such as Governance proposals surfaces the signals teams must investigate. DAO proposals and voting records reveal governance attack surfaces. Analysts review proposals for malicious payloads or vote-buying tactics.\nAdversaries repeatedly weaponize Bridge exploits. Cross-chain bridges are prime targets for logic flaws and key compromise. Audit bridge contracts, enforce multi-sig validations, and monitor large withdrawals.\nHistorical lessons from Wormhole exploit underline the stakes. A signature verification bug let attackers mint wrapped assets without collateral. Teams must validate elliptic curve checks and implement layered security.\nCommon mistake: Complex composability increases systemic risk across protocols.\n\n#### Operational guidance\nTranslate phishing attacks into practice by running scenario-based drills and documenting expected versus observed telemetry. Conduct war games simulating bridge, oracle, and governance attacks.\n\n### signature verification\nThe emphasis on signature verification within NFT and Crypto Wallet Security connects directly to frontline needs across the web3 security domain. Practitioners lean on Tenderly because Tenderly monitors DeFi contracts, simulates transactions, and provides debugging. Security teams simulate exploit scenarios, monitor on-chain metrics, and trigger alerts.\nKey telemetry such as Off-chain infrastructure logs surfaces the signals teams must investigate. Bridges, oracles, and APIs produce logs that highlight tampering or outages. Web3 defenders correlate off-chain logs with on-chain events to detect coordinated attacks.\nAdversaries repeatedly weaponize Reentrancy. Reentrancy allows attackers to repeatedly call functions before state updates. Use reentrancy guards, checks-effects-interactions pattern, and audit call flows.\nHistorical lessons from DAO hack underline the stakes. The 2016 DAO exploit drained millions of Ether via recursive calls.

Implement upgradeable proxies with rigorous access controls and timelocks.\n\n### hardware wallets\nThe emphasis on hardware wallets within NFT and Crypto Wallet Security connects directly to frontline needs across the web3 security domain. Practitioners lean on Slither because Slither performs static analysis of Solidity smart contracts to flag vulnerabilities. Security auditors integrate Slither into CI to catch reentrancy, access control, and arithmetic issues.\nKey telemetry such as On-chain transaction data surfaces the signals teams must investigate.

Design emergency pause mechanisms (circuit breakers) for critical contracts.\n\n### NFT marketplace scams\nThe emphasis on nft marketplace scams within NFT and Crypto Wallet Security connects directly to frontline needs across the web3 security domain. Practitioners lean on Foundry because Foundry provides fast smart contract development, fuzzing, and testing toolchains.
