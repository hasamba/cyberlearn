Some spread from computer to computer (like a cold), others hide and spy on you (like sneaky spies). Understanding malware helps you recognize and stop these digital germs.\n\n---\n\n# Deep Dive: Software Supply Chain Attacks\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### 1. SolarWinds\n\nThis concept covers essential aspects of malware security. At an intermediate level, you'll apply these concepts in practical situations and understand edge cases.\n\n### 2. Log4Shell case studies\n\nThis concept covers essential aspects of malware security. At an intermediate level, you'll apply these concepts in practical situations and understand edge cases.\n\n### 3. SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)\n\nThis concept covers essential aspects of malware security. At an intermediate level, you'll apply these concepts in practical situations and understand edge cases.\n\n### 4. Dependency scanning\n\nThis concept covers essential aspects of malware security. At an intermediate level, you'll apply these concepts in practical situations and understand edge cases.\n\n\n## Practical Application\n\nUnderstanding Software Supply Chain Attacks is critical for modern cybersecurity professionals. This knowledge directly applies to protecting malware systems in production environments.\n\n"
