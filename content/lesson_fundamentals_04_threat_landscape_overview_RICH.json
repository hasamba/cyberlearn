        "text": "**Sun Tzu wrote 2,500 years ago**: \"If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.\"\n\nThis lesson is about knowing your enemy.\n\n**Here's the reality**: Cybersecurity isn't about defending against abstract \"hackers\" - it's about defending against SPECIFIC threat actors with SPECIFIC motivations using SPECIFIC techniques. A ransomware gang operates differently than a nation-state APT group. A hacktivist has different goals than a cybercriminal.\n\n**Understanding the threat landscape** means understanding:\n- Who might attack you\n- Why they would attack\n- How they would attack\n- What they would target\n\n**Jim Kwik principle**: We'll use REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES extensively. You'll learn about actual threat groups like APT29 (Russian intelligence), Lazarus Group (North Korean), and FIN7 (cybercrime). Real names. Real attacks. Real techniques.\n\n**Why this matters**: Generic security controls defend against generic threats. Threat-informed defense - where you understand your specific adversaries - is exponentially more effective. Organizations that understand their threat landscape make smarter security investments.\n\n**Your goal**: By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to categorize threat actors, understand their motivations, and recognize common attack patterns. You'll think like an intelligence analyst, not just a technician."

      "content": {
        "text": "Understanding HOW attacks happen is as important as knowing WHO attacks.\n\n## 1. Phishing and Social Engineering\n\n**The #1 initial access vector**\n\n**Statistics**: 36% of breaches involve phishing (Verizon DBIR 2023)\n\n**Types**:\n\n**Email Phishing**:\n- Generic emails to thousands of targets\n- \"Your account has been compromised, click here\"\n- Low success rate but high volume\n\n**Spear Phishing**:\n- Targeted emails to specific individuals\n- Research victim on LinkedIn, social media\n- Personalized content\n- Much higher success rate\n\n**Whaling**:\n- Phishing targeting executives/high-value individuals\n- CEO fraud, wire transfer scams\n\n**Example**:\n```\nFrom: IT Department <it-support@company.com>\nTo: john.doe@company.com\nSubject: Urgent: Your email quota exceeded\n\nDear John,\n\nYour mailbox has exceeded its storage limit. Please verify your\naccount within 24 hours to avoid service interruption.\n\n[Verify Account]\n\n```\n\n**What makes it effective**:\n- From address looks legitimate (but check carefully!)\n- Creates urgency\n- Targets common pain point\n- Action button looks official\n\n## 2. Vulnerabilities and Exploits\n\n**Exploiting software weaknesses**\n\n**Types**:\n\n**Known Vulnerabilities** (CVEs):\n- EternalBlue (MS17-010): SMBv1 vulnerability, WannaCry ransomware\n- Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228): Log4j vulnerability, massive impact\n- ProxyShell (CVE-2021-34473): Microsoft Exchange, widespread exploitation\n\n**Zero-Day Vulnerabilities**:\n- Unknown to vendor\n- No patch available\n- Extremely valuable (sell for $100K-$1M+)\n- Used by nation-states\n\n**Example attack chain**:\n1. Attacker discovers vulnerable web server (Shodan, Censys)\n2. Identifies software version (banner grabbing)\n3. Searches exploit database (Exploit-DB, Metasploit)\n4. Runs exploit\n5. Gains initial access\n\n```bash\n# Example: Scanning for vulnerable systems\nnmap -sV -p 80,443,8080 --script vuln 192.168.1.0/24\n\n# Example: Searching for exploits\nsearchsploit apache 2.4.49\n```\n\n## 3. Credential Attacks\n\n**Stealing or guessing passwords**\n\n**Techniques**:\n\n**Brute Force**:\n- Try every possible password\n- Slow but works against weak passwords\n- \"password123\", \"admin\", \"123456\"\n\n**Credential Stuffing**:\n- Use leaked credentials from other breaches\n- Billions of username/password pairs available\n- People reuse passwords across sites\n\n**Password Spraying**:\n- Try common passwords against many accounts\n- Avoids account lockouts\n- \"Winter2024!\", \"Company123!\"\n\n**Example**:\n```bash\n# Password spraying against Active Directory\nImport-Module DSInternals\n$users = Get-ADUser -Filter *\n$commonPassword = \"Winter2024!\"\nforeach ($user in $users) {\n    Test-ADCredential -Username $user -Password $commonPassword\n}\n```\n\n**Phishing for Credentials**:\n- Fake login pages\n- Harvest usernames and passwords\n- Most effective method\n\n## 4. Supply Chain Attacks\n\n**Compromising trusted third parties**\n\n**Why effective**: Organizations trust their vendors\n\n**Notable Examples**:\n\n**SolarWinds (2020)**:\n- Attackers compromised SolarWinds Orion build system\n- Trojanized software updates\n- 18,000+ organizations received malicious update\n- Stealthy backdoor for months\n\n**Kaseya VSA (2021)**:\n- REvil ransomware gang\n- Compromised MSP software\n- Ransomware pushed to 1,500+ organizations\n- $70 million ransom demanded\n\n**CodeCov (2021)**:\n- Bash Uploader script compromised\n- Stole environment variables (credentials)\n- Hundreds of companies affected\n\n**Attack Chain**:\n1. Compromise software vendor\n2. Insert malicious code into product\n3. Customers download and install\n4. Attackers gain access to customers\n\n## 5. Remote Access Exploits\n\n**Targeting remote access solutions**\n\n**VPN Vulnerabilities**:\n- Pulse Secure\n- Fortinet FortiGate\n- Palo Alto GlobalProtect\n- Citrix NetScaler\n\n**RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)**:\n- BlueKeep (CVE-2019-0708)\n- Default port 3389 scanned constantly\n- Brute force attacks common\n\n**Example**: BlueKeep\n```\n# Vulnerable systems:\nWindows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Server 2008, XP, Server 2003\n\n# Impact:\n- Remote code execution without authentication\n- Wormable (can spread automatically)\n- Over 1 million systems vulnerable when disclosed\n```\n\n## 6. Web Application Attacks\n\n**Targeting web apps and APIs**\n\n**OWASP Top 10**:\n1. Broken Access Control\n2. Cryptographic Failures\n3. Injection (SQL, command, LDAP)\n4. Insecure Design\n5. Security Misconfiguration\n6. Vulnerable Components\n7. Authentication Failures\n8. Software and Data Integrity Failures\n9. Security Logging Failures\n10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)\n\n**SQL Injection Example**:\n```sql\n-- Vulnerable code:\nSELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$password'\n\n-- Attack:\nUsername: admin'--\nPassword: anything\n\n-- Resulting query:\nSELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin'--' AND password = 'anything'\n-- The -- comments out the password check!\n```\n\n## 7. Malware Delivery\n\n**How malware reaches victims**\n\n**Delivery Methods**:\n- **Email attachments**: Malicious Office docs, PDFs\n- **Drive-by downloads**: Compromised websites\n- **Malvertising**: Malicious advertisements\n- **USB drops**: Physical USB drives left in parking lots\n- **Watering hole**: Compromising sites victims visit\n\n**Example**: Emotet Infection Chain\n1. Phishing email with malicious Word doc\n2. User opens document\n3. Macro enables\n4. Macro downloads Emotet DLL\n5. Emotet downloads additional malware (TrickBot, Ryuk)\n6. Full system compromise\n\n## 8. Insider Threat Vectors\n\n**Abuse of legitimate access**\n\n**Methods**:\n- Data exfiltration to USB, cloud storage, email\n- Credential theft and lateral movement\n- Sabotage (deleting data, changing configurations)\n- Installing backdoors for future access\n\n**Red Flags**:\n- Access to data outside job role\n- Large data transfers\n- After-hours access\n- Recent disciplinary action or resignation notice\n\n## Memory Aid: Attack Vector Categories\n\n**\"PUSH CRIME\"**\n\n- **P**hishing\n- **U**nvulnerability (exploits)\n- **S**upply chain\n- **H**uman (social engineering)\n- **C**redentials\n- **R**emote access\n- **I**nsider\n- **M**alware\n- **E**nd-user applications (web apps)"

Map your defenses to MITRE ATT&CK**\n\n**Process**:\n1. Go to https://attack.mitre.org/\n2. Review the 14 tactics\n3. For each tactic, identify:\n   - ✅ Techniques you CAN detect\n   - ❌ Techniques you CANNOT detect\n4. Prioritize gaps\n5. Implement detections\n\n**Example**:\n```\nTactic: Initial Access\n\n✅ Can detect:\n- T1566.001 (Spearphishing Attachment) - Email gateway scans\n- T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Application) - WAF logs\n\n❌ Cannot detect:\n- T1078 (Valid Accounts) - No behavioral analytics\n- T1195 (Supply Chain Compromise) - No vendor monitoring\n\nAction: Implement UBA for detecting compromised accounts\n```\n\n**4. Start threat hunting**\n\nThreat hunting = proactively searching for threats in your environment\n\n**Hunt hypothesis example**:\n\"We suspect APT29 may have compromised our environment via spearphishing. Let's search for:\n- PowerShell execution with Base64-encoded commands\n- WMI event subscriptions for persistence\n- Unusual outbound connections to rare countries\"\n\n**Hunt query (Splunk)**:\n```spl\nindex=windows EventCode=4688 CommandLine=\"*powershell*\" CommandLine=\"*-enc*\"\n| stats count by Computer, User, CommandLine\n| where count > 1\n```\n\n**5. Practice threat modeling**\n\n**For a specific system, ask**:\n- What assets exist? (data, systems, services)\n- Who might attack it? (threat actors)\n- How might they attack? (attack vectors)\n- What's the impact? (data loss, downtime, reputation)\n- What controls exist? (defenses)\n- What gaps remain? (unmitigated risks)\n\n**Example: Web Application Threat Model**\n```\nAsset: Customer database (PII, payment info)\n\nThreats:\n- Cybercriminals (credential theft, SQL injection)\n- Insiders (data exfiltration)\n- Competitors (corporate espionage)\n\nAttack Vectors:\n- SQL injection (OWASP #3)\n- Broken authentication (OWASP #7)\n- Exposed credentials in code\n\nDefenses:\n- WAF (Web Application Firewall)\n- Input validation\n- Parameterized queries\n- MFA for admin accounts\n\nGaps:\n- No API security testing\n- Weak password policy\n- No database activity monitoring\n\nActions:\n- Implement API security testing\n- Enforce 16-character passwords\n- Deploy database audit logging\n```\n\n**6. Join threat intelligence communities**\n\n**ISACs** (Information Sharing and Analysis Centers):\n- **FS-ISAC**: Financial Services\n- **H-ISAC**: Healthcare\n- **E-ISAC**: Energy\n- **IT-ISAC**: Technology\n\n**Benefits**:\n- Early warning of threats\n- Peer collaboration\n- Incident response coordination\n- Threat intelligence sharing\n\n**7. Stay current**\n\n**Follow these sources**:\n- **Krebs on Security**: Brian Krebs (investigative reporting)\n- **Bleeping Computer**: Breaking security news\n- **The Hacker News**: Daily security updates\n- **Dark Reading**: Industry analysis\n- **SANS Internet Storm Center**: Daily threat briefings\n- **r/netsec**: Reddit security community\n- **Twitter/X**: Follow threat researchers\n\n**Recommended researchers to follow**:\n- @VK_Intel (Vitali Kremez - malware analysis)\n- @malwrhunterteam (malware hunting)\n- @GossiTheDog (Kevin Beaumont - threat intel)\n- @briankrebs (investigative journalism)\n- @MalwareTech (Marcus Hutchins)\n\n## Words of Encouragement\n\nThe threat landscape can feel overwhelming. Thousands of threat actors. Millions of malware samples. New vulnerabilities daily.\n\nBut here's the truth: **You don't need to defend against every threat. You need to defend against the threats relevant to YOU.**\n\nA small healthcare clinic doesn't need to worry about nation-state APTs targeting military secrets. A defense contractor doesn't need to worry about ransomware targeting retail.\n\n**Threat-informed defense means**:\n1. Understanding who might target you\n2. Understanding how they attack\n3. Prioritizing defenses against those specific threats\n\nThis is smarter, more effective, and more cost-efficient than trying to defend against everything.\n\n**Start small**:\n- Pick ONE threat actor relevant to your industry\n- Learn their TTPs\n- Implement detection for their top 3 techniques\n- Test your detection\n- Repeat\n\nOver time, you'll build comprehensive, threat-informed defenses.\n\n**Welcome to threat intelligence. Now go defend what matters.**"
