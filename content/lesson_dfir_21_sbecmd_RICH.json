SBECmd unlocks the Windows Shellbag (BagMRU and Bags) registry data so you can surface behavioral evidence that endpoint telemetry often misses. Think of the tool as a purpose-built archaeologist's brush: instead of blindly sifting through sand, you reveal precise fragments like folder view preferences capturing usb and network paths and last interaction timestamps including node slots that form a narrative of user activity.\n\n    ## Core Artifact Breakdown\n\n    - **Primary artifact:** Windows Shellbag (BagMRU and Bags) registry data.\n    - **Default location:** NTUSER.DAT and UsrClass.dat for each user profile.\n    - **Data captured:** Folder view preferences capturing USB and network paths, Last interaction timestamps including node slots, Shell item IDs referencing GUIDs, MFT entries, and server names, Evidence of deleted directories accessed by the user.\n\n    ### How Windows Records the Data\n\n    Before running the CLI, step back and picture how Windows populates this structure. Kernel callbacks, user-mode APIs, and background services all contribute entries. When a user launches an executable, Windows updates metadata, increments counters, and stores context. Even if adversaries delete logs or clear Prefetch, the windows shellbag (bagmru and bags) registry data often retains fingerprints. That's why responders lean on SBECmd to validate suspicious binaries and track behavior months later.\n\n    ### Flow from Collection to Output\n\n    1. Acquire the relevant files using KAPE, Velociraptor, or a forensic image.\n    2. Validate hashes of the evidence to maintain chain of custody.\n    3. Run SBECmd with targeted switches to parse the artifact.\n    4. Export to CSV/JSON and load into Timeline Explorer or your SIEM.\n    5. Correlate with complementary artifacts such as Prefetch, ShimCache, SRUM, or browser logs.\n\n    The combination of structural awareness and disciplined workflow keeps your interpretation defensible during litigation, tabletop reviews, or executive briefings.\n\n    ## Interpreting the Output Like a Pro\n\n    Teach your brain to read SBECmd output in layers. Start with high-level summaries—counts, time ranges, hostnames—and then zoom into individual entries. Highlight columns that expose shell item ids referencing guids, mft entries, and server names and evidence of deleted directories accessed by the user. Each record becomes a clue: who executed the binary, when, from which path, and what supporting metadata corroborates it?\n\n    ```\n    [Evidence Acquisition] --> [Parse with SBECmd] --> [Review Output] --> [Correlate Timelines] --> [Report Findings]\n    ```\n\n    ### Deep Metadata Orientation\n\n    Pay close attention to the column names emitted by SBECmd. Columns such as `LastWrite`, `SourcePath`, `ProgramID`, and `AssociatedDevice` each tell a different part of the story. Treat them like layers on a digital map: the timestamp shows when a pin was dropped, the path tells you which street the actor took, hashes validate identity, and device identifiers expose which workstation or USB stick participated.\n\n    Create a quick reference sheet as you review the CSV. Jot down the column definitions, the Windows subsystem that produced them, and one investigative pivot for each. For example, link `SHA1` to threat intelligence lookups, tie `ProgramID` to scheduled tasks, and pair `DeviceID` with USBSTOR registry keys.\n\n    ### Timeline Fusion Example\n\n    Suppose SBECmd reports that `psexesvc.exe` first appeared under `\\ADMIN$\temp` on 2023-07-14 18:23:10Z. Drop that timestamp into your global timeline and overlay Prefetch execution counts, Sysmon Event ID 1 records, and SMB flow logs. You can now watch the lateral movement unfold: PsExec stage uploaded, service installed, payload executed, and follow-on tools downloaded. This kind of fusion is what transforms raw entries into a narrative a CISO or prosecutor can understand.\n\n    ### Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting\n\n    ⚠️ **Beginners often misread timestamps.** Confirm whether the artifact stores UTC, local time, or last modified vs last execution data. When in doubt, compare with Event Log or SRUM entries.\n\n    ⚠️ **Security warning:** Never open suspect hives or binaries directly on your analysis workstation. Mount them via FTK Imager or copy into a sandbox VM before running SBECmd.\n\n    ⚠️ **Troubleshooting tip:** If you receive access errors, confirm the evidence was exported with alternate data streams intact and that you are running the tool with sufficient privileges.\n\n    ## Building Your Investigation Narrative\n\n    Use the data points exposed by SBECmd to answer executive-level questions: how the intrusion began, what tools executed, and whether there is evidence of staging for exfiltration. Tie observations back to MITRE ATT&CK techniques (for example, Focus on interpreting shell item structures, correlating node slots, and combining SBECmd output with timeline analytics to prove user intent.).\n\n    ### Teach Like I'm 10 Analogy\n\n    Imagine the artifact as your computer's journal. Every time someone opens a door (runs a program, accesses a folder, manipulates a file), the journal scribbles notes. SBECmd is the translator who reads the journal aloud in plain English. You listen for unusual doors opening at odd hours or unfamiliar visitors leaving breadcrumbs.\n\n    ### Minimum Effective Dose\n\n    Focus on the top 20% of output that yields 80% of insights:\n\n    - Proving a user accessed confidential folders on removable drives\n- Tracing staging directories used prior to exfiltration\n- Correlating remote share exploration with Jump List and LNK data\n- Identifying deleted folders and orphaned network paths\n\n    Each bullet is a pivot—practice pulling one example from past investigations and map it to the data columns you see today. Repetition is what makes you lightning fast during active incidents.\n\n    ## Investigative Metrics to Track\n\n    - **Evidence freshness:** Note the time delta between acquisition and parsing. The smaller it is, the less chance adversaries have to tamper with disk artifacts.\n    - **Correlation coverage:** Count how many supporting artifacts confirmed each high-risk entry. Your goal is at least two corroborating sources.\n    - **Containment speed:** Measure minutes from first SBECmd hit to isolation or credential reset. Share the metric with leadership to demonstrate improvement over time.\n    - **Detection uplift:** Record which Sigma or analytic rules you created after reviewing the artifact so detections get stronger every engagement.\n\n    Build these metrics into your case tracker so that every responder sees the value of this artifact in quantifiable terms.\n    ## Cross-Team Collaboration\n\n    Share your SBECmd findings with network defenders, threat intel analysts, and legal counsel. Provide raw CSVs, enriched timelines, and annotated screenshots. Invite them to poke holes in your interpretation—did you miss a scheduled task? Does the hash match a known ransomware toolkit? Collaboration turns one analyst's hypothesis into a verified conclusion.\n\n    ## Data Validation Checklist\n\n    - **Integrity:** Compare the parsed output with original evidence hashes to confirm no tampering.\n    - **Coverage:** Did you parse all relevant hives, directories, or Volume Shadow Copies?\n    - **Context:** Are there timezone offsets or daylight saving adjustments you must apply before presenting timestamps?\n    - **Reproducibility:** Document every command with switches so another responder can replicate the output verbatim.\n\n"

        "text": "\n# Advanced Workflows with SBECmd\n\nMastery begins when you use SBECmd not just to read artifacts but to test hypotheses. Start each investigation with a guiding question—*What did the adversary run to maintain persistence?* or *Where did the insider stage documents?*—and let the artifact confirm or deny it. When you anchor on a question, every field in the output becomes either supporting evidence or an avenue to disprove a theory.\n\n## Correlating with Other Artifacts\n\n| Artifact | Correlation Strategy |\n| --- | --- |\n| Prefetch | Align last run times with SBECmd data to confirm execution frequency. |\n| ShimCache | Validate first-touch paths to spot renamed binaries. |\n| SRUM | Compare network usage with execution spikes. |\n| Event Logs | Tie process creation events to hashed binaries exposed in SBECmd. |\n| USN Journal | Confirm file creation or deletion around key timestamps. |\n| Cloud Telemetry | Map host-based actions to SaaS or identity provider logs. |\n\nCombining these sources forms a lattice of truth. If one artifact lacks data, another usually fills the gap. Trace each suspicious entry through at least two corroborating artifacts before escalating to leadership.\n\n## Automation and Scripting\n\nDocument repeatable command lines. For example:\n\n```powershell\n# PowerShell wrapper for enterprise triage\n$targets = Get-Content ./hosts.txt\nforeach ($target in $targets) {\n    Invoke-Command -ComputerName $target -ScriptBlock {\n        & \"C:/Tools/SBECmd.exe\" -o \"C:/Temp/EZ\" -d \"C:/Evidence\" --csv\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPair automation with hash-based validation and logging to ensure evidence integrity. Store execution logs in a centralized location so the entire incident-response team can confirm which hosts were processed.\n\n## Analytical Deep Dive\n\nFocus on interpreting shell item structures, correlating node slots, and combining SBECmd output with timeline analytics to prove user intent.\n\nBreak the workflow into mini-sprints:\n\n1. **Ingest:** Gather evidence from live response kits or mounted images. Capture Volume Shadow Copies where possible to obtain historical views.\n2. **Normalize:** Convert outputs into CSV or JSON, add host metadata, time-zone offsets, and case numbers. Calculate derived fields such as execution duration, frequency of occurrence, and unique parent directories.\n3. **Visualize:** Load into Timeline Explorer, Kibana, or PowerBI to map trends. Highlight outliers such as signed Microsoft binaries running from user writeable paths.\n4. **Hypothesis testing:** Ask *What anomaly stands out?* and chase it through correlated artifacts. Challenge assumptions: could a scheduled task or patch cycle explain the behavior?\n5. **Report:** Translate technical findings into business impact using plain language and MITRE ATT&CK mapping. Provide recommended containment steps and detection improvements.\n\n## Real-World Reference Point\n\nForensic teams investigating the 2018 Tesla trade secrets theft used Shellbag data to show the insider repeatedly accessed engineering folders on a USB drive prior to resigning.\n\nBuild a habit of summarizing each case in a battle card: scenario, artifact pivot, commands used, false positives encountered, and remediation steps. This becomes institutional knowledge for your team and accelerates onboarding of new responders.\n\n## Skill Acceleration Exercises\n\n- **Active learning:** Re-run SBECmd on previously solved cases. Can you spot one more detail you missed the first time?\n- **Gamify it:** Race teammates to identify the first sign of execution or data staging using anonymized datasets. Award points for creative pivots.\n- **Meta-learning:** Ask yourself which question this artifact answers best, and which question requires a different tool.\n- **Connect to what you know:** Compare the artifact to everyday experiences—a library checkout log, a car's odometer, or a phone's call history—to ground the concept.\n\n## Troubleshooting and Edge Cases\n\n- **Volume Shadow Copies:** Use `--vss`, `--zip`, or similar switches (depending on the tool) to parse historical snapshots. Shadow copies often retain pre-attack states that prove persistence attempts.\n- **Locale Differences:** Some artifacts encode timestamps in FILETIME, others in UNIX epoch. Use `--json` to retain raw values if you suspect locale conversion issues.\n- **Massive Datasets:** For enterprise sweeps, break processing into batches and ingest results into a database. Tools like SQLite, Elastic, or Splunk handle millions of rows better than spreadsheets.\n- **Partial Data:** If entries lack hashes or paths, revisit acquisition. Was the hive truncated? Did you capture the correct control set?\n\n## Minimum Viable Playbook\n\nWrite a playbook entry in your team's knowledge base capturing:\n\n- Evidence sources and acquisition tips.\n- Command syntax with explanations.\n- Expected output fields and how to interpret them.\n- Validation steps and known pitfalls.\n\nThis ensures future responders achieve the same level of rigor even if you're not on the bridge call.\n\n## Cross-Team Collaboration\n\nShare your SBECmd findings with network defenders, threat intel analysts, and legal counsel. Provide raw CSVs, enriched timelines, and annotated screenshots. Invite them to poke holes in your interpretation—did you miss a scheduled task? Does the hash match a known ransomware toolkit? Collaboration turns one analyst's hypothesis into a verified conclusion.\n\n## Data Validation Checklist\n\n- **Integrity:** Compare the parsed output with original evidence hashes to confirm no tampering.\n- **Coverage:** Did you parse all relevant hives, directories, or Volume Shadow Copies?\n- **Context:** Are there timezone offsets or daylight saving adjustments you must apply before presenting timestamps?\n- **Reproducibility:** Document every command with switches so another responder can replicate the output verbatim.\n\n## Outcome Metrics\n\nTrack how long it takes to parse, analyze, and brief on SBECmd results. Measuring cycle time highlights opportunities for automation or playbook refinement. Record dwell-time reductions after deploying new detections inspired by this artifact.\n\n## Threat Modeling with SBECmd\n\nMap each field in the output to MITRE ATT&CK techniques. For instance, unusual hashes tie to T1105 (Ingress Tool Transfer), remote paths surface T1021 (Remote Services), and device associations can expose T1091 (Replication Through Removable Media). Having this mapping ready turns executive briefings into confident, standardized narratives.\n\n## Meta-Learning Reflection\n\nEnd each engagement by writing a short retrospective: which questions did SBECmd answer immediately, which required additional artifacts, and what automation would have shaved 30 minutes off the workflow? Revisiting these notes before the next incident primes your brain to operate faster.\n\n"

Mount the image read-only, copy the relevant windows shellbag (bagmru and bags) registry data files into `D:/Evidence/sbecmd`, and verify hashes.\n\n    ## Step-by-Step Commands\n\n    ```bash\n    $ SBECmd.exe -f path_to_artifact -d output_folder\n$ SBECmd.exe -d evidence_directory --csv --json\n$ SBECmd.exe -f evidence_item -o optional\n    ```\n\n    1. Run the first command to parse a single artifact. Inspect the CSV to identify folder view preferences capturing usb and network paths.\n    2. Execute the second command to recurse an entire directory. Note how SBECmd handles subfolders and aggregates results.\n    3. Apply the third command to explore optional switches like `-o` or advanced flags such as `--nl`.\n\n    ## Analysis Tasks\n\n    - Tag three entries that correlate with suspicious activity (for example, binaries signed by unknown publishers or paths referencing network shares).\n    - Cross-reference hostnames, SIDs, or device identifiers with Active Directory or asset inventories.\n    - Use `jq`, `pandas`, or Excel to filter on hash values, execution counts, or timestamps.\n\n    ## Automation Challenge\n\n    Write a Python snippet that ingests the CSV and surfaces top anomalies:\n\n    ```python\n    import csv\n    from collections import Counter\n\n    with open('output/sbecmd.csv', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n        rows = list(csv.DictReader(f))\n\n    by_path = Counter(row['Path'] for row in rows)\n    print('Most referenced paths:')\n    for path, count in by_path.most_common(5):\n        print(f\"{path}: {count}\")\n    ```\n\n    ## Extended Analysis Sprint\n\n    - Export the CSV into a Jupyter notebook and craft three pandas queries: one that surfaces the rarest paths, one that highlights unsigned binaries, and one that groups entries by user or device.\n    - Feed the JSON output into your SIEM and build a dashboard tile summarizing execution counts by day. Capture a screenshot to include in the incident report.\n    - Create a Sigma or KQL rule based on the artifact fields so your detection team can alert on similar behavior the next time it appears.\n\n    ## Verification Steps\n\n    After parsing, revisit the evidence source to double-check integrity. Recalculate hashes of the original hive or directory, compare them with acquisition logs, and note any mismatches. Run the tool with `--nl` or verbosity toggles to confirm lookup lists are behaving as expected.\n\n    ## Advanced Filtering Ideas\n\n    - Pivot on `SBECmd` output to identify binaries executed from network shares, temporary directories, or user profiles.\n    - Cross-reference hashes with VirusTotal, MISP, or your private threat intelligence platform.\n    - Normalize timestamps to UTC and align them with authentication logs to spot lateral movement corridors.\n\n    Document your findings in a short report: artifact summary, commands used, anomalies discovered, and recommended containment actions. Share it with your blue team to reinforce collaborative learning.\n\n    ## PowerShell Automation\n\n    ```powershell\n    # PowerShell wrapper for enterprise triage\n    $targets = Get-Content .\\hosts.txt\n    foreach ($target in $targets) {\n        Invoke-Command -ComputerName $target -ScriptBlock {\n            & \"C:\\Tools\\SBECmd.exe\" -o \"C:\\Temp\\EZ\" -d \"C:\\Evidence\"\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ## Scaling to the Enterprise\n\n    - Incorporate this command sequence into a KAPE target so responders can collect and parse the artifact in one sweep.\n    - Embed the utility into a Velociraptor artifact or SOAR playbook to trigger parsing when new hosts enroll in containment VLANs.\n    - Schedule periodic hunts that compare the latest outputs with historical baselines to catch first-time executions.\n\n    ## Post-Incident Review Checklist\n\n    - Did SBECmd reveal any process gaps (missing detection rules, delayed containment)? Capture them in your lessons-learned tracker.\n    - Update training decks with screenshots of notable rows so future responders recognize red flags instantly.\n    - Coordinate with threat intel to feed extracted hashes, paths, and device IDs into watchlists.\n\n"

Using SBECmd alongside EvtxECmd and MFTECmd exemplifies that multi-artifact approach.\n\n### Executive Communication Template\n\n```\nIncident: Insider staged files for exfiltration.\nArtifact: Windows Shellbag (BagMRU and Bags) registry data parsed with SBECmd.\nKey Finding: Folder view preferences capturing USB and network paths showing unauthorized access.\nAction: Disable compromised accounts, rotate credentials, notify compliance.\n```\n\n### ASCII Diagram of Correlation\n```\n[User Action] --> [Windows Shellbag (BagMRU and Bags) registry data] --> [SBECmd Output] --> [Timeline Explorer] --> [Executive Briefing]\n```\n\n### Additional Case Perspectives\n\n- **Healthcare Breach 2022:** Investigators at a Midwestern hospital used SBECmd alongside NetFlow to confirm that a contractor staged PHI archives in a hidden network share before exfiltration. The artifact provided the execution timeline necessary to meet HIPAA breach-reporting obligations.\n- **Manufacturing Intrusion 2023:** A LockBit affiliate relied on renamed PsExec copies. Even though Prefetch had been wiped, SBECmd preserved the remote share paths, allowing defenders to isolate compromised engineering workstations within minutes.\n\n### Executive Storytelling Template\n\n1. **Context:** Summarize the business impact, such as systems offline or data at risk.\n2. **Evidence:** Highlight one or two high-confidence entries from SBECmd that prove execution or access.\n3. **Correlation:** Reference the supporting artifacts—Sysmon, SRUM, Jump Lists—that align with the finding.\n4. **Action:** State containment steps already taken and list remaining investigative tasks.\n\n### What Beginners Get Wrong\n\n- Forgetting to adjust for time zones when correlating multi-region incidents.\n- Relying on default output without enriching hostnames or asset tags, which slows down the containment briefing.\n- Sharing raw CSVs without context, overwhelming stakeholders who need concise conclusions.\n\n### Immediate Action Items After Parsing\n\n1. Notify your detection engineering team about any new binaries or paths uncovered.\n2. Brief the incident commander with a 90-second summary focused on scope, risk, and next steps.\n3. Archive the parsed output, command logs, and screenshots in your evidence repository with clear naming conventions.\n\n### Memory Hooks\n- SHELL = Shares, Hidden folders, External media, Lateral movement, Locations.\n- Visualize the artifact as a surveillance camera log for the endpoint. Each row is a frame capturing who, what, when, and where.\n- Teach a teammate what you learned; explaining solidifies recall.\n\n"

Document three evidence pivots.\n- Import the output into Timeline Explorer or your SIEM, then craft a dashboard tile that flags anomalies related to this artifact.\n- Automate a scheduled hunt by wrapping the command in a PowerShell script that logs hostnames, evidence counts, and hashes.\n- Pair up with a teammate and run a five-minute lightning round where you quiz each other on artifact fields and investigative pivots.\n\n🎯 **Quick wins:** Apply one switch you rarely use—like `--recover`, `--maps`, or `--pretty`—to surface hidden data in a past case file. Share the result with your team, and note how the insight influenced containment or detection.\n\n🎯 **Resilience boosters:** When you hit confusing output, pause to ask “What would make this easier next time?” Maybe it's a parser alias, a cheat sheet, or an enrichment script. Convert that friction into a new workflow.\n\n🎯 **Next lesson preview:** We'll expand to the next EZ Tool and show how combining its output with what you mastered today creates compound visibility. Keep the momentum—you are building a complete Windows artifact arsenal.\n\nRemember: mastery comes from curiosity plus repetition. If any part felt complex, that's a sign you're leveling up. Rewatch your own notes, teach a peer what you learned, and celebrate the progress. The more you explain these artifacts, the more permanent the knowledge becomes. Keep iterating and logging your insights.\n\n### Next 24 Hours Plan\n1. Re-run {tool['name']} against a known-good baseline host to solidify muscle memory.\n2. Share one insight on your team's chat channel and invite questions.\n3. Update your personal playbook with today's command examples and screenshots so future incidents start faster.\n"
