Identify required tooling, the evidence collected, and the triage decisions the team must make. Capture command output, dashboards, and analyst notes.\n\n2. Draft a playbook segment around **Cookies**. Identify required tooling, the evidence collected, and the triage decisions the team must make. Capture command output, dashboards, and analyst notes.\n\n3. Draft a playbook segment around **Cache**. Identify required tooling, the evidence collected, and the triage decisions the team must make. Capture command output, dashboards, and analyst notes.\n\n4. Draft a playbook segment around **Downloads**. Identify required tooling, the evidence collected, and the triage decisions the team must make. Capture command output, dashboards, and analyst notes.\n\n5. Draft a playbook segment around **Autofill)**. Identify required tooling, the evidence collected, and the triage decisions the team must make. Capture command output, dashboards, and analyst notes.\n\n6. Draft a playbook segment around **Edge Chromium forensics**. Identify required tooling, the evidence collected, and the triage decisions the team must make. Capture command output, dashboards, and analyst notes.\n\nAfter the walkthrough, schedule a peer review. Each analyst explains what worked, what required escalation, and how to automate repetitive steps without losing investigative rigor.\n\nFinish by updating the runbook, linking recorded sessions, and tagging knowledge base articles so future rotations learn from the exercise."

Forensic analysts regrouped and replayed the timeline using the lesson structure from Web Browser Forensics - Chrome and Edge.\n\nThey cataloged the signals they missed, the collaboration friction they encountered, and the stakeholders who needed clearer communication. By aligning remediation tasks to the lesson structure, they closed visibility gaps and launched new detection backlogs.\n\nDuring the postmortem, the team recorded how executive updates, compliance obligations, and vendor coordination all tied back to the lesson pillars. This ensured future incidents would follow a confident, rehearsed pathway to containment.\n\nPlanning reminder: Modern Chromium-based browser forensics"
