Unlike IT networks, many OT assets lack encryption, authentication, or patching windows. DFIR responders must speak the language of operations: understand control loops, safety interlocks, and the consequences of taking devices offline. Create asset maps that differentiate between critical safety systems, process control networks, and corporate IT segments. Map vendor support agreements, firmware versions, and maintenance windows so you can coordinate actions without halting production.\n\nPre-incident preparation includes building relationships with control engineers and safety officers. Conduct joint tabletop exercises that simulate cyber-physical failures\u2014valves stuck open, pumps over-pressurized, or recipe tampering. Learn how HMI displays correlate to PLC registers and how manual overrides work. Document jump hosts, maintenance laptops, and engineering workstations that bridge IT and OT. When the alarm sounds, these relationships let you translate technical findings into operational risk instantly.\n\nRemember Jim Kwik's principle of connecting to what you know: treat PLC ladder logic like code, HMI configurations like application states, and historian data like SIEM telemetry. Build muscle memory through minimum effective dose drills\u2014weekly 15-minute sessions where DFIR analysts review a P&ID diagram with engineers and narrate potential attack paths.\""

Capture HMI images, historian exports, and network switch configs. Preserve network traffic by deploying passive taps or using span ports that do not introduce latency. Document every action with time, operator, and engineer sign-off.\n\nVolatile data lives in historian caches, alarm logs, and maintenance laptop RAM. Prioritize capturing these sources before they roll over. For Windows-based engineering stations, follow standard DFIR practices\u2014memory dumps, disk images, EDR telemetry\u2014but note unique software like Rockwell Studio 5000 or Siemens TIA Portal.
