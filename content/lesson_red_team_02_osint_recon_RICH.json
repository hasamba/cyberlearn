        "text": "Welcome to OSINT - the art of becoming invisible while gathering everything. Open Source Intelligence is one of the most powerful skills in cybersecurity, yet it requires ZERO hacking. You're about to learn how to extract massive amounts of information about targets using only publicly available data.\n\nHere's the profound truth: Organizations leak information constantly without realizing it. LinkedIn profiles reveal technology stacks. GitHub repositories contain credentials. Social media posts disclose security practices. Job postings advertise vulnerabilities. Your job is connecting these scattered puzzle pieces into actionable intelligence.\n\nThink of OSINT like being a detective in the digital age. Sherlock Holmes would be an OSINT master - observing tiny details, connecting seemingly unrelated facts, building complete pictures from fragments. That's your mission.\n\nThe beautiful part about OSINT: It's 100% legal and passive. You're not attacking systems. You're not breaking into networks. You're simply using your brain to analyze publicly available information. A skilled OSINT investigator can map an entire organization's infrastructure without ever touching their systems.\n\nHere's why this matters: Reconnaissance is the foundation of every red team engagement, penetration test, and cyber operation. The quality of your reconnaissance directly determines the success of your operation. Spend 60% of your time in reconnaissance and your attacks will be surgical. Rush reconnaissance and you'll miss critical attack vectors.\n\nReal-world truth: Many successful breaches start with OSINT. Attackers find exposed credentials on GitHub, identify vulnerable systems via Shodan, craft perfect phishing emails using social media analysis. OSINT isn't just gathering information - it's finding the keys to the kingdom.\n\nDevelop the OSINT mindset: Everything is connected. Every piece of information leads to another. Be patient, be thorough, and be creative. The best OSINT analysts think differently - they see connections others miss.\n\nLet's turn you into an intelligence gathering machine."

      "simplified_explanation": "OSINT = gathering information using only public sources (Google, social media, public databases).

      "teach_like_im_10": "Imagine you want to learn everything about a company. You can't sneak into their building, but you CAN read their website, look at their social media, see what their employees post online, and search Google. That's OSINT - being a super smart detective using only information that's already public!"

        "text": "## What is OSINT?\n\nOpen Source Intelligence (OSINT) is the collection and analysis of information from publicly available sources. Unlike classified intelligence or hacking, OSINT uses only legal, publicly accessible data.\n\n### The OSINT Mindset\n\n**Everything Leaves Digital Footprints**: Every organization, every person, every system leaves traces online. Your job is finding and connecting them.\n\n**Public Doesn't Mean Unimportant**: Just because information is public doesn't mean it's not sensitive. Configuration files on GitHub, employee posts about security tools, vendor documentation revealing architecture - all public, all valuable.\n\n**Patience Wins**: OSINT is not about quick wins. It's about systematic, methodical collection and analysis. The analyst who spends 40 hours on reconnaissance finds vulnerabilities the analyst who spends 4 hours misses.\n\n### The OSINT Methodology\n\n**Phase 1: Requirements Definition**\n- What are you trying to learn?\n- Who is the target?\n- What is your objective?\n- What are your constraints?\n\nExample:\n- Target: MegaCorp Inc.\n- Objective: Map external attack surface for penetration test\n- Constraints: Only public information, no direct interaction yet\n\n**Phase 2: Source Identification**\n- Where might relevant information exist?\n- What sources are available?\n- Which sources are most reliable?\n\n**Phase 3: Data Collection**\n- Systematically gather information from identified sources\n- Document everything\n- Maintain evidence chain\n\n**Phase 4: Processing and Analysis**\n- Connect the dots\n- Identify patterns\n- Validate information\n- Draw conclusions\n\n**Phase 5: Intelligence Production**\n- Create actionable intelligence\n- Document findings\n- Provide recommendations\n\n### OSINT Sources (The Goldmines)\n\n**Search Engines**:\nGoogle isn't just a search engine - it's an OSINT superpower when you master Google Dorking.\n\n**Google Dorks** (Advanced search operators):\n```\nsite:megacorp.com filetype:pdf confidential\n  → Find confidential PDFs on megacorp.com\n\nsite:megacorp.com inurl:admin\n  → Find admin pages\n\nintitle:\"index of\" \"backup\"\n  → Find exposed directories with backups\n\n\"megacorp.com\" filetype:env\n  → Find exposed .env files with credentials\n\nsite:github.com \"megacorp.com\" password\n  → Find passwords in GitHub repos\n\ninurl:8080 intitle:\"Dashboard\" \"Jenkins\"\n  → Find exposed Jenkins instances\n```\n\n**Domain and Network Information**:\n\n**WHOIS Lookup**:\n- Registrar information\n- Registration/expiration dates\n- Name servers\n- Registrant contact (often redacted, but sometimes exposed)\n- Historical WHOIS data (via viewdns.info)\n\n**DNS Enumeration**:\n```bash\n# Basic DNS lookup\ndig megacorp.com\nnslookup megacorp.com\n\n# Find mail servers\ndig megacorp.com MX\n\n# Find name servers\ndig megacorp.com NS\n\n# Attempt zone transfer (rarely works, but worth trying)\ndig axfr @nameserver megacorp.com\n\n# Subdomain enumeration\nsublist3r -d megacorp.com\namass enum -d megacorp.com\n```\n\n**Shodan** (The Internet Scanner):\nShodan indexes internet-connected devices. It's like Google for IoT devices, servers, routers, cameras, and more.\n\n```\n# Search for MegaCorp assets\norg:\"MegaCorp Inc\"\n\n# Find specific services\nport:3389 country:US org:MegaCorp\n  → Find RDP servers\n\nhttp.title:\"Jenkins\" org:MegaCorp\n  → Find Jenkins instances\n\nhttp.html:\"/phpmyadmin\" org:MegaCorp\n  → Find database admin panels\n```\n\nShodan reveals:\n- Exposed services and ports\n- Software versions (outdated = vulnerable)\n- Server locations\n- SSL certificate information\n- Login panels\n- Misconfigured devices\n\n**GitHub/GitLab** (Credential Goldmine):\n\nDevelopers accidentally commit sensitive information constantly:\n- API keys and tokens\n- Database credentials\n- SSH private keys\n- Configuration files (.env, config.php)\n- Internal documentation\n- Proprietary code\n\n```bash\n# GitHub search operators\norg:megacorp password\norg:megacorp api_key\norg:megacorp \"db_password\"\nfilename:.env org:megacorp\n```\n\nTools:\n- GitRob (GitHub security scanner)\n- TruffleHog (find secrets in git repos)\n- GitLeaks (detect hardcoded secrets)\n\n**Social Media Intelligence**:\n\n**LinkedIn** (Technology Stack Intelligence):\n- Employee profiles reveal skills (\"Experienced with Cisco ASA 5506\")\n- Job postings reveal technology (\"Seeking Windows Server 2012 Administrator\")\n- Company pages show employee count, locations\n- Posts reveal projects, initiatives, security practices\n\nExample findings:\n- CTO posts about migrating to AWS (you now know they use AWS)\n- Job posting seeks \"VMware ESXi 6.5 expert\" (you know virtualization platform and version)\n- Employee profile: \"Certified in Palo Alto Networks firewalls\" (you know firewall vendor)\n\n**Twitter/X**:\n- Employees discussing work\n- Conference presentations (often reveal architecture)\n- Complaints about tools or systems\n- Announcements about new technology\n\n**Facebook/Instagram** (For social engineering prep):\n- Personal information about employees\n- Relationships and connections\n- Hobbies and interests (for spear phishing)\n- Location check-ins\n\n**Company Websites and Documents**:\n\n**Websites**:\n- Technology fingerprinting (Wappalyzer, BuiltWith)\n- Contact forms (potential injection points)\n- Job postings (technology requirements)\n- Press releases (business intelligence)\n- Privacy policies (what data they collect/store)\n\n**Public Documents**:\n- SEC filings (for public companies)\n- Patents (technology details)\n- Vendor documentation (architecture insights)\n- Conference presentations (technical depth)\n\n**Archive.org (Wayback Machine)**:\n- Historical website data\n- Deleted pages (sometimes containing sensitive info)\n- Old job postings\n- Configuration files that were later removed\n\n**Metadata Extraction**:\n\nDocuments contain hidden metadata:\n- Author names (internal usernames)\n- Software versions (Adobe Acrobat 9.0 = outdated)\n- Internal file paths (C:\\\\Users\\\\john.smith\\\\Documents)\n- Company structure information\n- Creation/modification dates\n\nTools:\n- FOCA (metadata extraction and analysis)\n- exiftool (extract metadata from any file)\n- metagoofil (search Google for documents and extract metadata)\n\n### OSINT Frameworks and Tools\n\n**Reconnaissance Frameworks**:\n\n**Maltego** (Relationship Mapping):\n- Visual link analysis\n- Transforms to gather data from various sources\n- Maps relationships between people, companies, domains, IPs\n- Powerful for complex investigations\n\n**Recon-ng** (Reconnaissance Framework):\n```bash\n# Start recon-ng\nrecon-ng\n\n# Create workspace\nworkspaces create megacorp\n\n# Install modules\nmarketplace install all\n\n# Use module\nmodules load recon/domains-hosts/google_site_web\noptions set SOURCE megacorp.com\nrun\n```\n\n**SpiderFoot** (Automated OSINT):\n- Automated reconnaissance\n- Integrates 200+ data sources\n- Finds subdomains, emails, exposed services\n- Web-based interface\n\n**theHarvester** (Email and Subdomain Harvesting):\n```bash\n# Gather emails and subdomains\ntheHarvester -d megacorp.com -b all\n\n# Specific sources\ntheHarvester -d megacorp.com -b google,bing,linkedin\n```\n\n**Specialized OSINT Tools**:\n\n**Sherlock** (Username search across social media):\n```bash\nsherlock john_smith\n  → Searches 300+ social media sites for username\n```\n\n**Phonebook.cz** (Email and domain enumeration):\n- Find emails associated with domain\n- Find domains associated with person/company\n\n**Hunter.io** (Email finder):\n- Find email addresses for domain\n- Email pattern detection\n- Email verification\n\n### Advanced OSINT Techniques\n\n**Certificate Transparency Logs**:\nSSL certificates are publicly logged.

        "text": "**Pitfall 1: Information Overload Without Analysis**\nCollecting massive amounts of data but not analyzing it. You have 10,000 subdomains but haven't identified which ones are actually valuable. Solution: Collect AND analyze. Prioritize findings. Focus on actionable intelligence.\n\n**Pitfall 2: Relying on Single Sources**\nOnly using Google or only using Shodan. Single source = incomplete picture. Solution: Use multiple sources, cross-reference findings, validate information from multiple angles.\n\n**Pitfall 3: Not Documenting Sources**\nFinding critical information but not recording where it came from. When writing report, you can't cite sources or reproduce findings. Solution: Document everything - URL, timestamp, screenshot, source.\n\n**Pitfall 4: Ignoring False Positives**\nAssuming all found credentials are valid or all found vulnerabilities exist. Testing with invalid data wastes time and credibility. Solution: Validate findings whenever possible without crossing into active exploitation.\n\n**Pitfall 5: Crossing Legal Boundaries**\nUsing found credentials to log into systems during OSINT phase. Finding password and testing it = unauthorized access = crime. Solution: OSINT is PASSIVE. Document found credentials, don't use them until authorized.\n\n**Pitfall 6: Tunnel Vision on Technical Data**\nOnly looking for IPs and credentials, ignoring human intelligence. Social engineering vectors often more valuable than technical ones. Solution: Gather both technical and human intelligence - people are part of attack surface.\n\n**Pitfall 7: Not Considering Data Sensitivity**\nHandling discovered PII or credentials carelessly. Exposing them in reports to wrong audiences. Solution: Treat discovered sensitive data with extreme care, encrypted storage, need-to-know access.\n\n**Pitfall 8: Stopping at Surface Level**\nRunning automated tools and calling it done. The best intelligence comes from creative, deep investigation. Solution: Start with automation, but dig deeper manually. Follow interesting threads."
