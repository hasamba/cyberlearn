        "text": "# Introduction to BloodHound\n\nBloodHound is an Active Directory (AD) analysis tool that uses graph theory to uncover hidden relationships and privilege escalation paths within complex AD environments. By visualizing AD as a network graph, BloodHound provides defenders and attackers with a way to understand how users, groups, and permissions are interconnected.\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n- BloodHound maps AD trust relationships.\n- It identifies potential privilege escalation paths.\n- It aids both offensive and defensive security operations.\n\nBloodHound consists of two main components:\n1. **SharpHound** – The data collector that gathers AD information.\n2. **BloodHound GUI** – The analytical interface used to visualize and query the collected data.\n\nBloodHound is invaluable for both penetration testers seeking to exploit AD weaknesses and blue teams aiming to close privilege gaps before adversaries exploit them."

        "text": "# Understanding Active Directory Relationships\n\nActive Directory (AD) is inherently relational. Users belong to groups, groups have permissions on objects, and certain accounts have elevated privileges. BloodHound leverages these relationships through **graph theory**, where nodes represent objects and edges represent relationships.\n\n**Common Object Types:**\n- Users\n- Groups\n- Computers\n- Organizational Units (OUs)\n\n**Common Relationship (Edge) Types:**\n- `MemberOf`: Indicates group membership.\n- `HasSession`: Indicates where a user is logged in.\n- `AdminTo`: Represents administrative privileges.\n- `CanRDP`: Represents RDP access rights.\n\nUnderstanding these relationships allows analysts to trace complex attack paths that might otherwise be invisible in raw AD data."

Analysts can use **shortest path analysis** to find the quickest route from a low-privilege account to a domain admin.\n\n**Example Query:**\n- Find the shortest path to domain admin:\n  - `MATCH p=shortestPath((u:User {name:\"lowprivuser@example.local\"})-[:MemberOf*1..]->(g:Group {name:\"Domain Admins\"})) RETURN p`\n\n**Key Visualization Features:**\n- Node colors indicate object type.\n- Edge types show relationship paths.\n- Filters highlight specific privilege types.\n\nThis graph-based visualization transforms complex permission data into actionable insights for both offense and defense."

Initial access via phishing credentials.\n2. SharpHound run for AD enumeration.\n3. Graph analysis to identify 'CanRDP' → 'AdminTo' → 'Domain Admins' chain.\n4. Privilege escalation using discovered paths.\n`\n\n**Why It Worked:**\n- Overlapping group memberships.\n- Unrestricted delegation configurations.\n- Lack of monitoring for SharpHound-like activity.\n\n**Defense:**\n- Audit group memberships regularly.\n- Restrict administrative delegation.\n- Deploy honeypot users to detect reconnaissance attempts."
