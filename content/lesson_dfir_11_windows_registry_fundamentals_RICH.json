Practitioners document registry transaction logs (.log1/.log2) with exact timestamps, hostnames, and tool versions. They hash exports, store screenshots, and annotate notebooks so peers can verify every step. Adversaries manipulate registry transaction logs (.log1/.log2) through timestomping, selective deletion, and living-off-the-land binaries.
