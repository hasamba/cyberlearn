        "text": "\nLarge language models generate responses by predicting plausible continuations of text, not by consulting a ground-truth database. As a result, they can fabricate facts, sources, or credentials while sounding authoritative. Hallucinations may emerge from gaps in training data, ambiguous prompts, or attempts to answer beyond the model's knowledge. Adversaries can exploit this tendency by crafting prompts that encourage false statements about competitors, products, or public events. In sensitive domains like healthcare, finance, or legal advice, a single hallucinated claim can mislead decision-makers, expose organizations to liability, or erode public trust.\n\nMisinformation spreads quickly in connected workflows. Generated content might feed knowledge bases, marketing campaigns, or customer emails. If teams copy outputs without verification, errors propagate and become difficult to retract. Social engineering campaigns can even weaponize hallucinations—attackers seed false narratives by repeatedly prompting the model until it produces the desired misinformation, then share screenshots or transcripts as “evidence.” Understanding how and why hallucinations occur is the foundation for building resilient review processes.\n"

        "text": "\nMitigating hallucinations combines technical and procedural controls. Retrieval-augmented generation helps anchor responses in vetted documents, but only when sources are trustworthy and cited. Automated fact-checking pipelines can cross-reference statements against structured data or external APIs. When confidence is uncertain, the model should admit limitations and encourage users to consult a human expert. Interfaces must display citations, timestamps, and confidence scores so users can judge reliability. For high-risk outputs, require human approval and maintain audit trails showing who verified each statement.\n\nOperational practices are equally critical. Establish misinformation incident response plans that define triage, correction, and communication steps. Monitor for user feedback or external reports that highlight inaccuracies. When false content is discovered, issue corrections, retract affected documents, and analyze root causes—was the prompt unclear, the retrieval corpus outdated, or an attacker manipulating inputs? Training and awareness programs teach staff to verify model outputs, cite sources, and escalate suspicious claims. Over time, measuring hallucination rates and publishing transparency reports builds accountability.\n"
