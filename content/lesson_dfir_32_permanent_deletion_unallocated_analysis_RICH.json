This lesson equips you with operational muscle memory so that every acquisition, parsing action, and analytic pivot contributes to the overarching investigation timeline.\n\n## Core Foundations\n\nRecycle Bin $I and $R file structure anchors the fundamentals of permanent deletion and unallocated space analysis. Responders study how recycle bin $i and $r file structure behaves on healthy hosts so they can spot anomalies quickly. Practitioners document recycle bin $i and $r file structure with exact timestamps, hostnames, and tool versions. They hash exports, store screenshots, and annotate notebooks so peers can verify every step. Adversaries manipulate recycle bin $i and $r file structure through timestomping, selective deletion, and living-off-the-land binaries. Knowing the legitimate structure reduces the risk of misinterpreting tampered data. Collaboration works best when threat hunters, reverse engineers, and counsel share the same vocabulary for recycle bin $i and $r file structure. Briefing decks translate the artifact into business risk, containment priorities, and restoration plans. Skills mature when responders recreate recycle bin $i and $r file structure in lab environments, capture before-and-after evidence, and iterate on automation.
