Every file, directory, and process has associated permissions that control who can read, write, or execute them. Understanding this model is critical for:\n\n- **Defense**: Preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data\n- **Attack**: Exploiting misconfigurations during penetration tests\n- **Forensics**: Understanding what attackers accessed during incidents\n- **Compliance**: Meeting requirements like PCI-DSS, HIPAA\n\n**Real-World Impact**: The 2019 Capital One breach exploited a misconfigured AWS WAF that allowed access to files with overly permissive S3 bucket permissions. The attacker gained access to 100 million customer records.\n\n**Jim Kwik Mindset**: Permission management seems dry, but reframe it: you're learning the \"locks and keys\" of every Linux system you'll ever secure or test. Master this, and you control access to the digital kingdom."

SGID (Set-Group-ID) - Bit 2000\n\n**On Files**: Runs with file's **group privileges**\n**On Directories**: New files inherit the **directory's group** (not creator's group)\n\n```bash\ndrwxrwsr-x  2 alice developers  /shared/project\n      ↑\n      SGID bit\n```\n\n**Use Case**: Shared project directories where all files should belong to the \"developers\" group.\n\n```bash\nchmod 2775 /shared/project\n# Any file created inside gets group \"developers\" automatically\n```\n\n## 3. Sticky Bit - Bit 1000\n\n**Effect**: On directories, only file **owner can delete** their files (even if directory is group-writable).\n\n```bash\ndrwxrwxrwt  10 root root  /tmp\n         ↑\n         Sticky bit (t instead of x)\n```\n\n**Use Case**: `/tmp` directory - everyone can write, but users can't delete each other's files.\n\n```bash\nchmod 1777 /shared/temp\nchmod +t /shared/temp    # Symbolic mode\n```\n\n**Security Note**: Always check for unexpected SUID/SGID binaries - they're prime targets for privilege escalation!"

Dirty COW allowed overwriting read-only files\n2. Attackers targeted SUID binaries like `/usr/bin/passwd`\n3. Overwrote the binary with malicious code\n4. Malicious code ran as **root** (due to SUID)\n5. Instant root access on millions of systems\n\n**Real Attack Example**:\n```bash\n# Attacker finds vulnerable system\nuname -r  # Check kernel version\n\n# Exploit Dirty COW to replace /usr/bin/passwd\n./dirtycow /usr/bin/passwd malicious_payload\n\n# Run the now-malicious passwd (still has SUID root)\n/usr/bin/passwd\n# ... spawns root shell\n```\n\n**Defense Lessons**:\n1. **Minimize SUID binaries**: Remove unnecessary SUID bits\n2. **Monitor SUID files**: Track changes to SUID/SGID executables\n3. **Keep kernel updated**: Dirty COW was patched in Oct 2016\n4. **File integrity monitoring**: Tools like AIDE detect unauthorized changes\n\n**Audit Command**:\n```bash\n# Find and review all SUID/SGID files\nfind / \\( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \\) -type f -exec ls -ld {} \\; 2>/dev/null\n```"

(All users)\n- What privileges does it run with? (Root)\n- How to remove SUID? (`chmod u-s suspicious_tool` or `chmod 0755`)\n\n**Scenario 3**: Lock down SSH keys:\n```bash\nchmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa        # Private key: owner read/write only\nchmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub    # Public key: all can read\nchmod 700 ~/.ssh               # SSH directory: owner only\nchmod 644 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys # Authorized keys: owner rw, all read\n```"

World-Writable Directories**\n```bash\nfind / -type d -perm -002 ! -path \"/proc/*\" ! -path \"/sys/*\" 2>/dev/null\n# Found: /var/www/uploads with 777 permissions\n# Risk: Attacker uploads web shell, gains code execution\n```\n\n**2. Overly Permissive Sudo**\n```bash\n# /etc/sudoers\nwebadmin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\n# Risk: Compromise webadmin account = instant root\n```\n\n**3. SUID Binaries in User Directories**\n```bash\n-rwsr-xr-x  1 root root  /home/bob/custom_tool\n# Risk: User can modify binary, run arbitrary code as root\n```\n\n**4. Secrets with Weak Permissions**\n```bash\n-rw-r--r--  1 root root  /opt/app/database.credentials\n# Risk: Any user can read database passwords\n```\n\n## The $100 Million Mistake: Equifax Breach (2017)\n\nWhile primarily an unpatched vulnerability (CVE-2017-5638), **permission failures amplified the damage**:\n\n- Database credentials stored in **world-readable files**\n- Service accounts had **excessive privileges**\n- Logs were **writable by compromised accounts** (evidence tampering)\n\n**Result**: 147 million records stolen, $700M+ in costs\n\n**Lesson**: Permissions are the second line of defense when vulnerabilities exist."

        "text": "# Mastery Mindset: From Confusion to Confidence\n\n**Common Feeling**: \"There are so many permission modes, special bits, ACLs... I'll never remember all this!\"\n\n**Reframe**: You don't need to memorize everything - you need to **internalize patterns**.\n\n## The 80/20 Rule for Permissions\n\n**80% of real-world scenarios use**:\n- **644** for files (configs, web content)\n- **755** for directories and executables\n- **600** for secrets (keys, credentials)\n- **sudo** for controlled privilege escalation\n\n**Master these four**, and you'll handle most situations confidently.\n\n## Learning Strategy (Jim Kwik Method)\n\n1. **Active Recall**: Don't just read permission strings - practice calculating them\n   - See \"rwxr-x---\" → Think \"754\" → Verify\n   - See \"755\" → Think \"rwxr-xr-x\" → Verify\n\n2. **Spaced Repetition**: Review this material in:\n   - 1 day (quick scan)\n   - 1 week (practice exercises)\n   - 1 month (real-world application)\n\n3. **Teach to Learn**: Explain SUID to a peer or write a blog post - teaching forces deep understanding\n\n4. **Real-World Application**: On your next system:\n   ```bash\n   # Audit your own permissions\n   find ~ -type f -perm -o+w  # Find world-writable files in home\n   ```\n\n**Remember**: Every expert was once confused by chmod. The difference? They practiced until it became second nature. You're on that same path right now!"

        "text": "# Reflection and Next Steps\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n1. **Linux permissions are three layers**: user/group/others with read/write/execute\n2. **chmod** manages permissions (numeric: 644, 755; symbolic: u+x, go-w)\n3. **Special permissions** (SUID/SGID/sticky) modify execution behavior - powerful but risky\n4. **ACLs** provide granular control beyond traditional permissions\n5. **sudo** enables controlled privilege escalation when configured securely\n6. **File attributes** (immutable, append-only) protect even against root\n7. **Principle of least privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions\n\n## Practice Exercises\n\n1. **Audit Your System**: Run `find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null` and research each SUID binary found\n2. **Lock Down SSH**: Verify your `~/.ssh` directory has correct permissions\n3. **Create Shared Directory**: Practice setting up SGID directory for team collaboration\n4. **Test ACLs**: Grant a friend temporary read access to a project using setfacl\n5. **Sudo Configuration**: Create a sudoers entry that allows restarting a service without password\n\n## What's Next?\n\nYou've mastered the **foundation of Linux security** - file permissions. Next lessons will build on this:\n- **Process Management**: Permissions in action (which user runs which process?)\n- **Networking**: File permissions for sockets and network configs\n- **Shell Scripting**: Automating permission audits and hardening\n\n**Challenge**: Before moving on, can you explain to someone (or write down) why `chmod 777` is dangerous and what you'd use instead for a shared directory?\n\nIf you can, you've truly understood this lesson. If not, revisit the SGID and sticky bit sections - the answer lies there!"
