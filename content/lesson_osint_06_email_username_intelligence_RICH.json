        "text": "## Welcome to Email & Username Intelligence\n\nYou're about to unlock one of the most powerful OSINT techniques: email and username intelligence. Think about it - every person leaves digital breadcrumbs across the internet through their email addresses and usernames. These seemingly simple identifiers are keys that unlock entire digital identities.\n\n**Here's why this matters**: In 2023, security researchers discovered a massive phishing campaign targeting Fortune 500 companies. How did they track down the attackers? By following email patterns, username reuse, and breach correlations. The skills you're learning today are the same skills that stopped a multi-million dollar attack.\n\n**The Jim Kwik Principle at Work**: We're using active learning here - you won't just read about email OSINT, you'll DO it. You'll search for real email addresses, correlate usernames across platforms, and analyze email headers. This hands-on approach creates stronger memory pathways than passive reading ever could.\n\n**Your mindset shift**: Email intelligence isn't about hacking or breaking into accounts. It's about connecting the dots that are already publicly visible. It's detective work in the digital age. Companies hire professionals with these skills to protect their employees from phishing, to investigate threats, and to understand their digital footprint.\n\n**Remember**: Every expert was once a beginner. The person who discovered the Twitter hack of 2020 started exactly where you are now - learning email enumeration basics. Stay curious, practice ethically, and document everything you learn. Let's dive in!"

        "text": "## Understanding Email Intelligence\n\nEmail addresses are among the most valuable pieces of information in OSINT investigations. They serve as unique identifiers that connect individuals across multiple platforms and services. A single email address can unlock:\n\n- Social media profiles (Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter)\n- Professional networks and employment history\n- Data breach exposure and compromised credentials\n- Domain ownership and infrastructure details\n- Communication patterns and associates\n\n### Email Format Enumeration\n\nMost organizations follow predictable email patterns. Understanding these patterns allows you to enumerate valid email addresses even without direct access to a company directory.\n\n**Common Email Patterns**:\n- **FirstLast@company.com** (john.smith@acme.com) - Most common\n- **First.Last@company.com** (john.smith@acme.com)\n- **FLast@company.com** (jsmith@acme.com)\n- **FirstL@company.com** (johns@acme.com)\n- **First_Last@company.com** (john_smith@acme.com)\n\n**Real-world example**: In 2022, a security researcher enumerated 15,000 valid email addresses from a Fortune 500 company using only publicly available employee names from LinkedIn and the company's documented email format. This wasn't hacking - it was pattern recognition.\n\n### Email Validation vs Verification\n\n**Validation** checks if an email follows proper format (user@domain.tld):\n```regex\n^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$\n```\n\n**Verification** confirms the email actually exists and can receive messages:\n- DNS MX record lookup (does the domain accept email?)\n- SMTP server connection (does the mailbox exist?)\n- Catch-all detection (does the server accept all addresses?)\n\n**Tools for Email Enumeration**:\n\n1. **Hunter.io** - Enterprise email finder\n- Free tier: 25 searches/month\n- Shows email patterns for domains\n- Confidence score for each result\n- Sources: Where email was found\n\n2. **RocketReach** - Contact information database\n- 450+ million professional profiles\n- Verification status included\n- Social media linkage\n\n3. **Snov.io** - Email finder and verifier\n- LinkedIn integration\n- Bulk email verification\n- Email drip campaigns (for marketing, not OSINT)\n\n### Email Header Analysis\n\nEmail headers contain forensic gold for tracking message origins:\n\n**Key Header Fields**:\n```\nReceived: from mail.sender.com (192.168.1.100)\nX-Originating-IP: 203.0.113.42\nMessage-ID: <abc123@sender.com>\nAuthentication-Results: spf=pass smtp.mailfrom=sender.com\nDKIM-Signature: v=1; a=rsa-sha256; d=sender.com\n```\n\n- **Received** headers show the full routing path (read bottom-to-top)\n- **X-Originating-IP** reveals sender's actual IP address\n- **Message-ID** uniquely identifies the email\n- **SPF/DKIM/DMARC** authentication results show email legitimacy\n\n**Case Study - Business Email Compromise (BEC)**:\n\nIn 2021, a company nearly lost $2.3 million to a BEC scam. The finance department received an email that appeared to be from the CEO requesting an urgent wire transfer. A vigilant employee analyzed the email headers and discovered:\n\n```\nReceived: from mail.suspicious-domain.ru (185.220.xxx.xxx)\nX-Originating-IP: 185.220.101.25 [Russia]\n```\n\nThe sender had spoofed the \"From\" field but couldn't fake the routing headers. The scam was stopped because someone knew how to read email headers.\n\n### Disposable Email Detection\n\nDisposable or temporary email services (10minutemail, Guerrilla Mail, TempMail) are commonly used by threat actors to:\n- Register fake accounts\n- Bypass email verification\n- Conduct phishing campaigns\n- Maintain anonymity\n\n**Detection Techniques**:\n1. **Domain blacklists**: Check against known disposable email domains (1,000+ known services)\n2. **MX record analysis**: Many disposable services share mail servers\n3. **Pattern matching**: Randomized usernames (user12345@tempmail.com)\n4. **API services**: Kickbox, EmailRep, and others maintain updated lists\n\n**Example disposable email domains**:\n- 10minutemail.com\n- guerrillamail.com\n- mailinator.com\n- tempmail.com\n- throwaway.email"

        "text": "## Username OSINT: The Digital Fingerprint\n\nUsernames are often reused across multiple platforms, creating a trail that investigators can follow. This technique, called \"username enumeration\" or \"username pivoting,\" is fundamental to linking online identities.\n\n### Why Username Reuse Matters\n\n**Statistics**: Research shows 52% of internet users reuse the same username across 3+ platforms. For privacy-conscious users, this number drops to 30%, but that's still a significant correlation opportunity.\n\n**Real-world Impact**: In 2020, investigators tracking a cybercriminal group found a username \"shadowh4ck3r\" used across:\n- GitHub (code repositories)\n- Twitter (communications)\n- Reddit (technical discussions)\n- HackForums (underground activity)\n- Steam (gaming - revealing real name)\n\nThis single username led to a full identity reveal and eventually arrest.\n\n### Username Search Tools\n\n**1. Sherlock** - Multi-platform username checker (300+ sites)\n```bash\n# Install Sherlock\ngit clone https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock.git\ncd sherlock\npip3 install -r requirements.txt\n\n# Search for username across platforms\npython3 sherlock username_here\n\n# Output example:\n[+] Twitter: https://twitter.com/username_here\n[+] GitHub: https://github.com/username_here\n[+] Instagram: https://instagram.com/username_here\n[-] Facebook: Not Found\n```\n\n**2. WhatsMyName** - Web-based username enumeration\n- 500+ platforms checked\n- No installation required\n- Results show account creation dates (when available)\n\n**3. Namechk** - Domain and social media availability\n- Checks username availability\n- Also checks domain registration (.com, .net, etc.)\n- Useful for brand protection\n\n**4. Holehe** - Email to account checker\n```bash\n# Install holehe\npip3 install holehe\n\n# Check if email is registered on various platforms\nholehe email@example.com\n\n# Results show:\nTwitter: Registered ✓\nSpotify: Registered ✓\nLinkedIn: Not Registered ✗\nDiscord: Registered ✓\n```bash\n\n### Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) Integration\n\n**HIBP** is the internet's largest database of breached credentials, containing 12+ billion compromised accounts from 600+ data breaches.\n\n**Founded by**: Troy Hunt (Microsoft Regional Director)\n**Breaches indexed**: Every major breach since 2013\n**API Access**: Free for reasonable use\n\n**Checking for Breaches**:\n\n```bash\n# Using HIBP API (requires API key - free)\ncurl -H \"hibp-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY\" \\\n\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/api/v3/breachedaccount/email@example.com\"\n\n# Response shows:\n[\n{\n\"Name\": \"LinkedIn\",\n\"Title\": \"LinkedIn\",\n\"Domain\": \"linkedin.com\",\n\"BreachDate\": \"2012-05-05\",\n\"AddedDate\": \"2016-05-21\",\n\"PwnCount\": 164611595,\n\"DataClasses\": [\"Email addresses\", \"Passwords\"]\n},\n{\n\"Name\": \"Adobe\",\n\"BreachDate\": \"2013-10-04\",\n\"PwnCount\": 152445165\n}\n]\n```\n\n**What This Tells You**:\n- Which breaches exposed this email\n- What data was compromised (passwords, phone numbers, etc.)\n- When the breach occurred\n- How many total accounts were affected\n\n**Ethical Use**: HIBP is designed for individuals to check their own exposure and for security teams to protect their organizations. Never use it to exploit compromised accounts.\n\n### Professional Email Intelligence\n\n**LinkedIn Sales Navigator** (Paid Tool):\n- Advanced search filters\n- Email discovery for premium members\n- Export contact lists\n- Job change alerts\n\n**Free Alternative - LinkedIn Manual OSINT**:\n1. Find employee profiles via Google: `site:linkedin.com \"Company Name\" \"Job Title\"`\n2. Note name patterns\n3. Cross-reference with Hunter.io email patterns\n4. Verify with email validation tools\n\n**GitHub Email Extraction**:\n```bash\n# Clone a repository\ngit clone https://github.com/username/repo.git\ncd repo\n\n# Extract all commit author emails\ngit log --format='%ae' | sort -u\n\n# Results:\nuser@personal-email.com\nuser@company-email.com\ndev@opensource-project.org\n```\n\nThis technique reveals:\n- Personal email addresses\n- Corporate email addresses\n- Email address changes over time\n- Multiple identities of the same person"

        "text": "## Real-World Case Studies\n\n### Case Study 1: Twitter Hack of 2020 - Email Enumeration Gone Wrong\n\n**Incident Date**: July 15, 2020\n**Impact**: 130 high-profile Twitter accounts compromised (Elon Musk, Barack Obama, Bill Gates, Apple, Uber)\n**Financial Loss**: $117,000 stolen in Bitcoin (could have been millions)\n\n**How Email Intelligence Revealed the Attackers**:\n\nThe attackers weren't sophisticated hackers - they were teenagers who used social engineering and email enumeration:\n\n1. **Initial Reconnaissance**: Attackers enumerated Twitter employee email addresses using LinkedIn profiles and standard corporate email patterns (@twitter.com)\n\n2. **Spear Phishing**: Targeted employees with fake IT security alerts sent to discovered email addresses\n\n3. **Username Reuse**: One attacker used the same username \"Kirk\" across multiple platforms:\n- Discord (where attack was coordinated)\n- OGUsers forum (where credentials were sold)\n- Coinbase (for laundering Bitcoin)\n- Gaming platforms (revealed real identity)\n\n4. **Investigation Breakthrough**: FBI investigators used:\n- Email header analysis from phishing attempts\n- Blockchain tracking to Coinbase account\n- Username correlation from Kirk#5270 on Discord\n- Holehe-style platform enumeration\n- OSINT on associated email addresses\n\n**Arrests Made**:\n- Graham Ivan Clark (17, Tampa, FL) - Mastermind\n- Mason Sheppard (19, UK) - Username \"Chaewon\"\n- Nima Fazeli (22, Orlando, FL)\n\n**Key Lesson**: Username reuse and email patterns left an unmistakable trail. Professional OSINT tools identified the attackers within 48 hours.\n\n**Sources**: Department of Justice press releases, FBI investigation reports, blockchain analysis by Chainalysis\n\n### Case Study 2: BEC Scam Stopped by Header Analysis\n\n**Company**: Mid-sized manufacturing firm (anonymized)\n**Date**: March 2021\n**Attempted Loss**: $2.3 million\n**Actual Loss**: $0 (attack stopped)\n\n**Attack Timeline**:\n\n**Day 1 - 09:15 AM**: Finance department receives email:\n```\nFrom: CEO Robert Johnson <rjohnson@company.com>\nSubject: URGENT - Confidential Wire Transfer Required\n\nWe are finalizing a confidential acquisition. Please wire $2.3M to:\nAccount: 1234567890\nBank: Industrial & Commercial Bank of China\nRouting: 987654321\n\nThis must remain confidential until the announcement.\n```\n\n**Day 1 - 09:30 AM**: Finance manager performs standard email header check:\n\n```\nReceived: from mail.sender-spoofed.ru (185.220.101.42)\nby company-mx.outlook.com\nX-Originating-IP: 185.220.101.42 [Russia]\nAuthentication-Results: spf=fail; dkim=fail; dmarc=fail\nReturn-Path: <randomstring@sender-spoofed.ru>\n```\n\n**Red Flags Identified**:\n- ✗ Originating IP from Russia (company has no operations there)\n- ✗ SPF failure (not sent from authorized email server)\n- ✗ Return-Path mismatch (different domain)\n- ✗ No DKIM signature from company domain\n\n**Day 1 - 09:45 AM**: Security team contacted, confirms CEO is in meeting and sent no such email\n\n**Day 1 - 10:00 AM**: Incident reported to FBI, header details provided\n\n**Outcome**: Attack prevented, $2.3 million saved. FBI investigation identified the same IP address in 47 other BEC attempts across multiple countries.\n\n**Company's Defense**: Mandatory email header analysis training for all finance personnel. Total training cost: $5,000. Money saved: $2.3 million. ROI: 46,000%.\n\n### Case Study 3: Bellingcat Investigation - Identifying Russian GRU Officers\n\n**Organization**: Bellingcat (investigative journalism)\n**Investigation**: Novichok poisoning of Sergei Skripal (2018)\n**Technique**: Email and username correlation OSINT\n\n**Methodology**:\n\n1. **Initial Data**: Leaked Russian databases containing passport photos and personal details\n\n2. **Email Pattern Discovery**: Russian GRU uses predictable patterns:\n- firstname.lastname@gru.ru (official)\n- firstnamelastname@yandex.ru (personal)\n\n3. **Username Enumeration**: Found GRU officer usernames on:\n- VKontakte (Russian Facebook)\n- Odnoklassniki (Russian social network)\n- Auto.ru (car sales - revealed travel patterns)\n- Booking.com (hotel reservations near poisoning location)\n\n4. **Email Header Analysis**: Tracked login locations via:\n- Email metadata from leaked databases\n- IP address geolocation\n- Timezone analysis from email timestamps\n\n5. **Cross-Reference**: Correlated:\n- Passport photos\n- Social media profiles\n- Email patterns\n- Username reuse\n- Phone number linkage\n\n**Result**: Positive identification of GRU officers Petrov and Boshirov (aliases) as Alexander Mishkin and Anatoliy Chepiga. UK government confirmed identities.\n\n**Impact**: International arrest warrants issued. Demonstrated power of open-source intelligence.\n\n**Bellingcat Tools Used**:\n- Yandex reverse image search\n- VKontakte profile enumeration\n- Email pattern matching\n- Holehe-style platform checking\n- Passive DNS reconnaissance\n\n**Legal Note**: All information came from publicly available or leaked sources.

How does this change your view of digital privacy?\n\n**Question 2**: Think about your own email addresses and usernames. Do you reuse them across platforms? What trail might you be leaving?\n\n**Question 3**: The Twitter hack case study showed teenagers using basic OSINT to compromise major accounts. What does this tell you about the importance of email security and username hygiene?\n\n**Question 4**: How could the email intelligence techniques you learned today be applied in your current or future career?\n\n### Career Applications\n\n**Security Analyst / SOC Analyst**:\n- Investigating phishing campaigns\n- Tracking threat actors across platforms\n- Validating security alerts\n- Conducting incident response\n\n**Threat Intelligence Analyst**:\n- Attributing attacks to specific groups\n- Mapping adversary infrastructure\n- Discovering IOCs (Indicators of Compromise)\n- Building threat actor profiles\n\n**Fraud Investigator**:\n- Identifying fraudulent accounts\n- Linking multiple fraud attempts\n- Discovering organized fraud rings\n- Validating customer identities\n\n**Penetration Tester / Red Teamer**:\n- Reconnaissance phase\n- Enumerating targets for social engineering\n- Understanding employee patterns\n- Testing email security controls\n\n**Digital Forensics Investigator**:\n- Tracking suspects across platforms\n- Correlating digital evidence\n- Timeline analysis\n- Identity verification\n\n**Privacy & Compliance Officer**:\n- Assessing organizational digital footprint\n- Identifying PII exposure\n- Breach impact assessment\n- Third-party risk evaluation\n\n### Industry Certifications That Value These Skills\n\n- **GIAC OSINT Fundamentals (GOSI)**\n- **Certified Threat Intelligence Analyst (CTIA)**\n- **SANS SEC487: Open-Source Intelligence Gathering and Analysis**\n- **Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)** - Domain 7\n- **CompTIA CySA+** - Threat intelligence section\n\n### Building Your Portfolio\n\n**Project Ideas**:\n1. **Personal Digital Footprint Audit**: Conduct complete email/username OSINT on yourself, document findings\n2. **Corporate Email Pattern Analysis**: Analyze Fortune 500 email patterns, create pattern database\n3. **Breach Notification System**: Build automated monitoring using HIBP API\n4. **Phishing Detection Tool**: Create email header analyzer with red flag scoring\n5. **Username Correlation Dashboard**: Build visualization of username connections\n\n**Share Your Work** (Ethically):\n- Write blog post about email OSINT methodology\n- Create open-source tool for email pattern detection\n- Present findings at local security meetups\n- Contribute to Sherlock or similar OSINT tools\n- Document case studies (with permission/anonymization)\n\n### Ethical Considerations Moving Forward\n\n**Always Remember**:\n- Just because information is discoverable doesn't mean you should exploit it\n- Privacy is a human right - respect it\n- Get authorization before investigating organizations\n- Never use credentials you discover, even if they work\n- Document your methodology for legal defensibility\n- Follow responsible disclosure practices\n\n**Red Lines - Never Cross**:\n- Don't access accounts without permission\n- Don't use discovered information for harassment\n- Don't share personally identifiable information publicly\n- Don't conduct investigations for unauthorized purposes\n- Don't bypass authentication or security controls\n\n### Next Steps in Your OSINT Journey\n\n**Immediate Practice**:\n1.

      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "question": "You receive an urgent email from your company's CFO requesting an immediate wire transfer of $500,000 for a confidential acquisition. The email header shows the following:\n\n```\nFrom: CFO Sarah Chen <schen@yourcompany.com>\nReceived: from mail.sender-relay.cn (203.0.113.42)\nX-Originating-IP: 203.0.113.42 [China]\nAuthentication-Results: spf=fail; dkim=fail; dmarc=fail\nReturn-Path: <random123@sender-relay.cn>\n```\n\nWhat is the MOST appropriate immediate action?",
      "options": [
        "Process the wire transfer immediately as requested since it's from the CFO's email address",
        "Flag as phishing - the header shows SPF/DKIM/DMARC failures, suspicious originating IP, and mismatched Return-Path domain",
        "Reply to the email asking for confirmation before processing",
        "Forward the email to your bank to verify the account details"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "This is a clear Business Email Compromise (BEC) phishing attempt. Despite the email showing 'From: schen@yourcompany.com', the headers reveal multiple red flags:\n\n1. **SPF Fail**: Email not sent from authorized mail server for yourcompany.com\n2. **DKIM Fail**: Missing or invalid cryptographic signature\n3. **DMARC Fail**: Failed domain-based authentication policy\n4. **Originating IP**: From China (203.0.113.42), suspicious if company has no operations there\n5. **Return-Path Mismatch**: Shows 'sender-relay.cn' instead of yourcompany.com domain\n6. **Domain Spoofing**: Attacker spoofed the From address but can't fake authentication\n\nOption A is dangerous - never trust the From field alone. Option C is risky - replying confirms your email is active. Option D delays necessary security response. \n\n**Correct action**: Immediately flag as phishing, notify security team, and verify request through alternative communication channel (phone call to CFO). The FBI reports BEC scams cost businesses $2.4 billion annually - header analysis is critical defense.",

      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "question": "During an OSINT investigation, you discover a target uses the username 'cyberwarrior2023' on GitHub, where they've committed code with the email 'john.smith.personal@gmail.com'. Using Sherlock, you find the same username on Twitter, Reddit, and a hacking forum. HIBP shows this email was in the 2021 LinkedIn breach with password exposure. What is the MOST valuable next step for your investigation while staying within ethical and legal boundaries?",
      "options": [
        "Attempt to log into the GitHub account using common passwords from the LinkedIn breach to verify the connection",
        "Examine the public GitHub repositories for additional intelligence (emails in commits, project collaborators, code patterns) and correlate with public social media profiles",
        "Create a fake account on the hacking forum using similar credentials to infiltrate and gather intelligence",
        "Use the discovered email to send a phishing email to gather more information about the target"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Option B is the only legal and ethical approach. Here's why:\n\n**Option B (CORRECT)**: \n- Analyzing **public** GitHub repositories is legal OSINT\n- Git commit history may reveal: Additional email addresses, collaborator networks, project interests, coding patterns, time zones (from commit timestamps)\n- Public social media correlation is legal when viewing publicly accessible information\n- This creates a comprehensive profile without any unauthorized access\n- Professional investigators use this exact methodology (see Bellingcat investigations)\n\n**Option A (ILLEGAL)**: \n- Unauthorized access to accounts is a violation of Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) in US, Computer Misuse Act in UK\n- Even if the password works, logging in without authorization is a crime\n- Maximum penalty: 10 years imprisonment, $250,000 fine (CFAA)\n- Compromised credentials should never be used, even for 'verification'\n\n**Option C (ILLEGAL & UNETHICAL)**:\n- Creating fake accounts to infiltrate communities violates:\n  - Platform Terms of Service\n  - Potentially CFAA (unauthorized access through deception)\n  - Professional ethics standards\n- Evidence gathered this way may be inadmissible in legal proceedings\n\n**Option D (ILLEGAL)**:\n- Sending phishing emails is illegal under:\n  - CAN-SPAM Act (US)\n  - Anti-Phishing Act\n  - Wire fraud statutes\n- Maximum penalty: 20 years imprisonment for wire fraud\n- No 'legitimate' investigation justifies sending phishing emails\n\n**Key Principle**: OSINT is about discovering and correlating **publicly available** information, never unauthorized access or deception. The username correlation already provides valuable intelligence - GitHub projects reveal technical skills, interests, and professional network. Social media reveals personal interests, location, associates. This is sufficient for most legitimate investigations without crossing legal/ethical boundaries.",
