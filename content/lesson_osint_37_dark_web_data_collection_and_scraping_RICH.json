Identify required tooling, the evidence collected, and the triage decisions the team must make. Capture command output, dashboards, and analyst notes.\n\n2. Draft a playbook segment around **evasion techniques**. Identify required tooling, the evidence collected, and the triage decisions the team must make.

Draft a playbook segment around **marketplace monitoring**. Identify required tooling, the evidence collected, and the triage decisions the team must make. Capture command output, dashboards, and analyst notes.\n\nAfter the walkthrough, schedule a peer review. Each analyst explains what worked, what required escalation, and how to automate repetitive steps without losing investigative rigor.\n\nFinish by updating the runbook, linking recorded sessions, and tagging knowledge base articles so future rotations learn from the exercise."

Intelligence analysts regrouped and replayed the timeline using the lesson structure from Dark Web Data Collection and Scraping.\n\nThey cataloged the signals they missed, the collaboration friction they encountered, and the stakeholders who needed clearer communication. By aligning remediation tasks to the lesson structure, they closed visibility gaps and launched new detection backlogs.\n\nDuring the postmortem, the team recorded how executive updates, compliance obligations, and vendor coordination all tied back to the lesson pillars. This ensured future incidents would follow a confident, rehearsed pathway to containment.\n\nPlanning reminder: Scalable underground data collection"

Picture sticky notes, dashboards, and alerts all echoing these letters so the practice becomes muscle memory.\n\n- W \u2013 Lessons Learned\n- D \u2013 Resilience Testing\n- C \u2013 Automation Backlog\n- A \u2013 Telemetry Mapping\n- S \u2013 Stakeholder Briefing\n\nTurn both memory tools into cue cards, whiteboard sketches, and spaced-repetition prompts so the team revisits them weekly."
