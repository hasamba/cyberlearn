        "text": "# Threat Hunting Methodologies\n\nIn the previous lesson, you learned the **fundamentals** of threat hunting. Now, we'll dive into **specific methodologies** you can apply to find adversaries in your environment.\n\nThink of methodologies as your **hunting playbook** - proven approaches that guide your investigations and increase your chances of success.\n\n## Crown Jewels Analysis: Know What to Protect\n\n### What Are Your Crown Jewels?\n\n**Crown Jewels** are your organization's most valuable assets - the data, systems, or resources that, if compromised, would cause the most damage.\n\nExamples:\n- **Financial Services**: Customer financial data, trading algorithms\n- **Healthcare**: Patient health records (PHI/PII)\n- **Manufacturing**: Intellectual property, CAD designs\n- **Tech Companies**: Source code, customer databases\n- **Government**: Classified information, citizen data\n\n### Why Crown Jewels Matter for Hunting\n\n**Attackers target your crown jewels**. They don't care about your guest WiFi - they want:\n- Data they can sell\n- Systems they can ransom\n- Credentials for high-value access\n- Intellectual property to steal\n\n**Threat hunters prioritize hunt efforts around crown jewels**.\n\n### Conducting Crown Jewels Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify Assets**\n\nList your organization's most critical:\n- **Data**: Customer data, financial records, IP\n- **Systems**: Domain controllers, databases, payment systems\n- **People**: Executives, admins, developers\n- **Services**: Email, VPN, cloud infrastructure\n\n**Step 2: Assess Impact**\n\nFor each asset, ask:\n- What happens if this is compromised?\n- How much would it cost (financially, reputationally)?\n- Would we survive a breach of this asset?\n\n**Impact Rating**:\n- **Critical**: Organization-ending threat (e.g., ransomware on production DB)\n- **High**: Severe damage, regulatory fines (e.g., PII breach)\n- **Medium**: Business disruption (e.g., email outage)\n- **Low**: Minimal impact (e.g., guest WiFi compromise)\n\n**Step 3: Map Attack Paths**\n\nHow would an attacker reach your crown jewels?\n\n```\n[Initial Access] → [Lateral Movement] → [Crown Jewel]\n\nExample:\n[Phished User] → [Pivot to File Server] → [Steal IP]\n[Compromised VPN] → [Privilege Escalation] → [Domain Admin] → [Entire Network]\n```\n\n**Step 4: Prioritize Hunts**\n\nFocus hunt efforts on:\n1. **Direct Crown Jewel Access**: Monitor crown jewels themselves\n2. **Attack Paths**: Watch systems on the path to crown jewels\n3. **High-Value Targets**: Users with privileged access\n\n### Real-World Example: Crown Jewels Hunt\n\n**Scenario**: Healthcare organization\n\n**Crown Jewel**: Electronic Health Records (EHR) database\n\n**Hunt Hypothesis**: \"If an attacker is targeting our EHR database, they would need to:\n1. Compromise a user with database access\n2. Establish persistence on a jump box\n3. Exfiltrate data via SQL queries\"\n\n**Hunt Actions**:\n- Monitor database admin account usage\n- Hunt for persistence mechanisms on database servers\n- Search for large SQL query outputs\n- Look for unusual data exfiltration patterns\n\n**Result**: Proactively defending what matters most."

        "text": "## TTP-Based Hunting\n\n### Understanding TTPs\n\nRemember **TAP** from the previous lesson:\n- **Tactics**: Adversary goals (what they want)\n- **Techniques**: Methods to achieve goals (how they do it)\n- **Procedures**: Specific implementations (actual tools/commands)\n\n**TTP-based hunting** means hunting for adversary behaviors rather than specific indicators.\n\n### Why Hunt by TTPs?\n\n**Indicators change constantly**:\n- Adversaries change IP addresses, domains, file hashes\n- Signature-based detection is a losing game\n\n**TTPs are more consistent**:\n- Adversaries need persistence (tactic)\n- They use scheduled tasks, registry keys, startup items (techniques)\n- These behaviors are harder to change\n\n### TTP Hunt Example 1: Credential Dumping\n\n**Tactic**: Credential Access (TA0006)\n**Technique**: OS Credential Dumping (T1003)\n**Sub-Techniques**:\n- T1003.001 - LSASS Memory (Mimikatz)\n- T1003.002 - Security Account Manager (SAM)\n- T1003.003 - NTDS.dit (Active Directory database)\n\n**Hunt Hypothesis**: \"If an attacker is dumping credentials, they would access LSASS memory or SAM registry keys.\"\n\n**Hunt Query (Sysmon)**:\n```\nindex=windows EventCode=10 TargetImage=\"*lsass.exe\"\n| where SourceImage NOT IN (\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\wbem\\\\wmiprvse.exe\", known_good_processes)\n| stats count by SourceImage, SourceUser\n```\n\n**What This Finds**:\n- Processes accessing LSASS (potential Mimikatz)\n- Excludes known-good Windows processes\n- Groups by source process and user\n\n### TTP Hunt Example 2: Lateral Movement via RDP\n\n**Tactic**: Lateral Movement (TA0008)\n**Technique**: Remote Services - Remote Desktop Protocol (T1021.001)\n\n**Hunt Hypothesis**: \"If an attacker is moving laterally, they would use RDP from unexpected systems.\"\n\n**Hunt Query (Windows Event Logs)**:\n```\nindex=windows EventCode=4624 LogonType=10\n| eval is_server=if(match(ComputerName, \"SERVER|DC\"), \"yes\", \"no\")\n| where is_server=\"no\"\n| stats count by SourceNetworkAddress, TargetUserName, ComputerName\n| where count > 5\n```\n\n**What This Finds**:\n- RDP logins (LogonType=10)\n- To non-server systems (workstation-to-workstation RDP is suspicious)\n- Multiple attempts from same source\n\n### TTP Hunt Example 3: PowerShell Execution\n\n**Tactic**: Execution (TA0002)\n**Technique**: Command and Scripting Interpreter - PowerShell (T1059.001)\n\n**Hunt Hypothesis**: \"If an attacker is using PowerShell for execution, they would run encoded or obfuscated commands.\"\n\n**Hunt Query (PowerShell Logs)**:\n```\nindex=windows EventCode=4104\n| where ScriptBlockText contains \"IEX\" OR ScriptBlockText contains \"-EncodedCommand\" OR ScriptBlockText contains \"DownloadString\"\n| stats count by Computer, UserName, ScriptBlockText\n```\n\n**What This Finds**:\n- Invoke-Expression (IEX) - commonly used to run downloaded scripts\n- Encoded commands (obfuscation)\n- DownloadString (downloading and executing remote scripts)\n\n### Building a TTP Hunt Library\n\nCreate a hunt for each common TTP:\n\n**Persistence** (TA0003):\n- T1053 - Scheduled Tasks\n- T1547 - Boot/Logon Autostart\n- T1546 - Event Triggered Execution\n\n**Defense Evasion** (TA0005):\n- T1070 - Indicator Removal\n- T1027 - Obfuscated Files or Information\n- T1562 - Impair Defenses (disable AV)\n\n**Collection** (TA0009):\n- T1560 - Archive Collected Data\n- T1113 - Screen Capture\n- T1005 - Data from Local System\n\n**Memory Aid**: **PTD-CED** for common hunt tactics:\n- **P**ersistence\n- **T**otal (Credential Access)\n- **D**efense Evasion\n- **C**ollection\n- **E**xfiltration\n- **D**iscovery"
