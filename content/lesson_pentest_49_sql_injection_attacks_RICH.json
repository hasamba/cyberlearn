Penetration testers regrouped and replayed the timeline using the lesson structure from SQL Injection Attacks.\n\nThey cataloged the signals they missed, the collaboration friction they encountered, and the stakeholders who needed clearer communication. By aligning remediation tasks to the lesson structure, they closed visibility gaps and launched new detection backlogs.\n\nDuring the postmortem, the team recorded how executive updates, compliance obligations, and vendor coordination all tied back to the lesson pillars. This ensured future incidents would follow a confident, rehearsed pathway to containment.\n\nPlanning reminder: Database exploitation"
