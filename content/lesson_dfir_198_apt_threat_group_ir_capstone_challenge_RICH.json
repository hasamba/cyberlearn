Forensic analysts regrouped and replayed the timeline using the lesson structure from APT Threat Group IR Capstone Challenge.\n\nThey cataloged the signals they missed, the collaboration friction they encountered, and the stakeholders who needed clearer communication. By aligning remediation tasks to the lesson structure, they closed visibility gaps and launched new detection backlogs.\n\nDuring the postmortem, the team recorded how executive updates, compliance obligations, and vendor coordination all tied back to the lesson pillars. This ensured future incidents would follow a confident, rehearsed pathway to containment.\n\nPlanning reminder: Final capstone - requires all FOR508 skills"

Picture sticky notes, dashboards, and alerts all echoing these letters so the practice becomes muscle memory.\n\n- T – Lessons Learned\n- G – Resilience Testing\n- I – Automation Backlog\n- C – Telemetry Mapping\n- C – Stakeholder Briefing\n\nTurn both memory tools into cue cards, whiteboard sketches, and spaced-repetition prompts so the team revisits them weekly."
