      "question": "You find a ShimCache entry for `C:\\Users\\Public\\malware.exe` with Last Modified Time of 2024-03-15 14:30:00. What does this ShimCache entry DEFINITIVELY prove?",
      "options": [
        "The executable was run on 2024-03-15 at 14:30:00",
        "The executable file existed and was accessed by the system",
        "The user double-clicked the executable to launch it",
        "The executable was downloaded from the internet on 2024-03-15"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "ShimCache entries prove FILE EXISTENCE and system interaction, NOT execution. The Last Modified Time is the file's $STANDARD_INFORMATION timestamp from the filesystem, not when it ran. ShimCache is created when Windows checks for compatibility shims (Explorer browsing, file properties, etc.), which doesn't require execution. To prove execution, you need Prefetch, AmCache (FirstExecuted timestamp), or BAM/DAM. However, ShimCache is still valuable because it shows the file existed on the system and was processed by Windows—useful for deleted malware or files copied from USB drives."

      "options": [
        "Windows 10 ShimCache limit is exactly 1,024 entries (older entries are purged)",
        "This indicates ShimCache corruption or tampering",
        "The system has been running for approximately 1,024 days",
        "Each entry represents one executed program per day"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 0,
      "explanation": "Windows 10 (and Server 2016+) has a ShimCache limit of exactly 1,024 entries (increased from 96 in Windows XP, 512 in Win7/8). When the cache fills, the oldest entries are purged in a FIFO manner. This is forensically significant because: (1) On heavily-used systems, ShimCache may only contain recent weeks/months of activity, (2) Critical early-stage malware evidence might be purged, (3) You need to check backups or Volume Shadow Copies for older ShimCache data. Windows 7/8/Server 2012 had a 512-entry limit, so seeing exactly 512 entries on those systems indicates a full cache."

      "question": "During ransomware investigation, you find ShimCache entries for `C:\\Temp\\encrypt.exe`, `C:\\Temp\\vssadmin.exe`, and `C:\\Windows\\System32\\vssadmin.exe` (legitimate). The Temp\\vssadmin.exe entry has Last Modified Time matching the legitimate System32 version. What does this indicate?",
      "options": [
        "False positive—Windows creates duplicate ShimCache entries for the same file",
        "Attacker copied legitimate vssadmin.exe to Temp\\ to delete shadow copies",

        "vssadmin.exe was timestomped to hide malicious modification"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Ransomware operators commonly copy legitimate Windows tools (vssadmin.exe, wbadmin.exe, bcdedit.exe) to Temp\\ or other writable directories to avoid detection and ensure execution. The matching Last Modified Time proves the file was COPIED (preserving original timestamps) rather than created fresh. This technique is used because: (1) Running tools from System32 may trigger EDR alerts, (2) Copying to Temp\\ provides a staging area with full user write permissions, (3) Attackers can modify copied tools or run them with different command-line arguments. Next steps: Check Prefetch for C:\\Temp\\vssadmin.exe execution (will show command-line: 'delete shadows /all /quiet'), verify with Event Logs (4688 process creation, 7036 VSS service termination), check MFT for file creation time in Temp\\."

        "ShimCache entries are false positives from previous investigations"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Files executed directly from NETWORK SHARES (UNC paths like \\\\server\\share\\file.exe) do NOT create Prefetch files—Prefetch only tracks executables run from local drives (C:, D:, E:, etc.). This is a common APT lateral movement technique to avoid Prefetch evidence. However, ShimCache DOES track UNC path executions, making it critical for detecting network-based attacks. The forensic approach: (1) ShimCache UNC paths prove network share access and file interaction, (2) Check Event Logs for network logon (4624 Type 3) from source IP, (3) Check BAM/DAM (Background Activity Moderator) which tracks execution regardless of location, (4) Check Amcache for SHA-1 hashes even for network executions. The C:\\Windows\\Temp\\procdump.exe entry suggests tools were also COPIED locally (staging for credential dumping)."

        "System clock was changed between file access and execution"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 0,
      "explanation": "The 2-minute gap indicates USER INTERACTION DELAY. Here's what happened: (1) 14:30:00 - User browsed to the file in Explorer or viewed file properties, triggering ShimCache creation (ShimCache is written when Explorer accesses file metadata for compatibility checks), (2) 14:30:00-14:32:15 - User decision time (reading filename, deciding whether to execute, possibly scanning with antivirus), (3) 14:32:15 - User double-clicked, execution began (Prefetch + AmCache created), (4) 14:32:16 - Process creation event logged. This pattern is common in phishing attacks where users receive email attachments, browse to Downloads folder (ShimCache), then execute after deliberation. If the gap were hours/days, it might indicate reconnaissance before execution. If there were NO gap (same timestamp), it suggests automated execution (script, scheduled task, service startup) rather than user interaction."

        "text": "# Shimcache (AppCompatCache) Forensics\n\n## Opening: The Silent Witness to Every Program\n\nWelcome to one of the most powerful—yet misunderstood—artifacts in Windows forensics: **ShimCache** (also called AppCompatCache).\n\n**Why this lesson matters**: ShimCache tracks EVERY executable Windows encounters, creating a historical record of programs on the system—even if they were deleted, run from USB drives, or executed over network shares. For investigators, this is forensic gold.\n\n**The critical distinction**: ShimCache does NOT definitively prove execution (that's Prefetch's job), but it proves FILE EXISTENCE and system interaction. This makes ShimCache invaluable for:\n- Detecting malware that was present but deleted before imaging\n- Tracking tools run from network shares (no Prefetch created)\n- Identifying staging directories for attack tools\n- Building comprehensive program timelines\n\n**Real-world impact**: In a 2023 APT investigation, Prefetch showed no evidence of lateral movement tools (PsExec, Mimikatz). ShimCache revealed 23 entries for these tools run from UNC paths (`\\\\DC01\\ADMIN$\\...`), exposing the complete attack chain.\n\nLet's master ShimCache analysis.\n\n---\n\n## Part 1: Understanding ShimCache Purpose and Structure\n\n### What is ShimCache?\n\n**Official purpose**: Windows Application Compatibility Cache tracks executables to apply compatibility \"shims\" (code modifications) for older programs running on newer Windows versions.\n\n**Forensic purpose**: ShimCache becomes a historical log of every executable Windows has encountered.\n\n**How it works**:\n1. User browses to a folder containing executables (Explorer accesses file metadata)\n2. Windows checks if compatibility shims are needed\n3. File path and metadata are cached in the Registry\n4. Cache persists across reboots (stored in SYSTEM hive)\n\n**Key insight**: ShimCache entries are created when Windows accesses executable metadata, which can happen through:\n- File Explorer browsing\n- Right-clicking → Properties\n- Actual program execution\n- Antivirus scanning\n- Backup software accessing files\n\n**What this means forensically**: ShimCache proves the file EXISTED and was PROCESSED by Windows, but doesn't definitively prove execution (unlike Prefetch).\n\n### Registry Location\n\n**Path**: `HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\AppCompatCache`\n\n**Value**: `AppCompatCache` (binary data)\n\n**Structure**: Binary blob containing array of ShimCache entries\n\n**Extraction requirement**: Use specialized parsers (AppCompatCacheParser, RegRipper) to decode binary format\n\n### Windows Version Differences\n\n**Critical for interpretation**:\n\n| Windows Version | Max Entries | Execution Flag | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Windows XP | 96 | ✅ Yes | Inserted flag shows if file was executed |\n| Windows 7/8/Server 2012 | 512 | ❌ No | Execution flag removed (existence only) |\n| Windows 10/Server 2016+ | 1,024 | ❌ No | Doubled capacity, no execution flag |\n\n**XP special case**: ShimCache on Windows XP includes an \"Inserted\" flag that indicates execution, making it more definitive. On Windows 7+, this flag was removed due to privacy concerns.\n\n**Capacity implications**: When cache fills (1,024 on Win10), oldest entries are purged FIFO (First In, First Out). Heavy-use systems may only retain recent weeks/months.\n\n---\n\n## Part 2: Extracting ShimCache with AppCompatCacheParser\n\n### Eric Zimmerman's AppCompatCacheParser\n\n**Tool**: `AppCompatCacheParser.exe` (part of Eric Zimmerman Tools suite)\n\n**Basic extraction**:\n```cmd\nAppCompatCacheParser.exe -f \"C:\\Evidence\\SYSTEM\" --csv \"C:\\Output\"\n```\n\n**Output**: CSV file with columns:\n- **CacheEntryPosition** (0-1023, newest = 0)\n- **Path** (full executable path)\n- **LastModifiedTimeUTC** (file's $STANDARD_INFORMATION timestamp)\n- **Executed** (Windows XP only, otherwise \"N/A\")\n\n**Advanced options**:\n```cmd\nAppCompatCacheParser.exe -f \"SYSTEM\" --csv \"Output\" -t --mp --nl\n```\n- `-t`: Include file modified times\n- `--mp`: Show cache entry position\n- `--nl`: Suppress header line\n\n**Sample output**:\n```\nCacheEntryPosition,Path,LastModifiedTimeUTC,Executed\n0,C:\\Users\\Public\\malware.exe,2024-03-15 14:30:00,N/A\n1,C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe,2024-03-15 14:28:42,N/A\n2,\\\\FileServer01\\Tools\\mimikatz.exe,2024-03-15 14:25:15,N/A\n```\n\n**Interpretation**:\n- Position 0 = most recent ShimCache entry\n- malware.exe in Users\\Public = suspicious location\n- UNC path = network share execution (common in lateral movement)\n\n### RegRipper Alternative\n\n**Plugin**: `appcompatcache`\n\n**Command**:\n```bash\nrip.exe -r \"SYSTEM\" -p appcompatcache > shimcache_output.txt\n```\n\n**Output format**:\n```\nLastModified: 2024-03-15 14:30:00\nPath: C:\\Users\\Public\\malware.exe\n\nLastModified: 2024-03-15 14:28:42\nPath: C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe\n```\n\n**Advantage**: Human-readable text format\n\n**Disadvantage**: Less flexible than CSV for timeline analysis\n\n---\n\n## Part 3: Analyzing ShimCache Entries\n\n### Identifying Suspicious File Paths\n\n**High-risk locations** (common malware staging areas):\n\n```\nC:\\Users\\Public\\*\nC:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\*\nC:\\Windows\\Temp\\*\nC:\\ProgramData\\*\nC:\\Temp\\*\nC:\\$Recycle.Bin\\*\n```\n\n**Why these matter**:\n- **Users\\Public**: World-writable, no admin required, often used by downloaders\n- **Temp folders**: Temporary malware staging before persistence installation\n- **ProgramData**: Hidden by default, used for malware impersonating legitimate software\n- **Recycle Bin**: Attackers hide tools in deleted file containers\n\n**Network share paths** (APT lateral movement):\n```\n\\\\<IP>\\ADMIN$\\*\n\\\\<IP>\\C$\\*\n\\\\<servername>\\Share\\*\n```\n\n**Example analysis**:\n```\nC:\\Users\\Alice\\Downloads\\Invoice_March.exe  ← Suspicious (Invoice.exe in Downloads = phishing)\n\\\\10.50.30.15\\ADMIN$\\psexec.exe            ← Lateral movement tool from remote system\nC:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\WindowsUpdate\\wuaueng.exe  ← Malware mimicking Windows Update\n```\n\n### Correlating with Prefetch for Execution Proof\n\n**Workflow**:\n\n**Step 1**: Extract ShimCache entries\n```\nmalware.exe → LastModified: 2024-03-15 14:30:00\n```\n\n**Step 2**: Check for Prefetch file\n```\nC:\\Windows\\Prefetch\\MALWARE.EXE-A1B2C3D4.pf\n```\n\n**Step 3**: Parse Prefetch\n```\nPECmd.exe -f \"MALWARE.EXE-A1B2C3D4.pf\"\nLast Run Time: 2024-03-15 14:32:15\nRun Count: 3\n```\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- ShimCache proves file EXISTED at 14:30:00\n- Prefetch proves file EXECUTED at 14:32:15 (first of 3 times)\n- 2-minute gap = user browsed to file before running it\n\n**If Prefetch is MISSING**:\n- File may have been run from network share (no Prefetch for UNC paths)\n- Prefetch may have been disabled/deleted (anti-forensics)\n- File may not have actually executed (ShimCache alone doesn't prove execution)\n\n**Backup artifacts** to check:\n- **AmCache**: Contains FirstExecuted timestamp (proves execution)\n- **BAM/DAM**: Background Activity Moderator (execution tracking on Win10+)\n- **Event Logs**: Security 4688 (process creation), Sysmon 1 (process start)\n\n### Detecting Copied Legitimate Tools\n\n**Ransomware tactic**: Copy Windows tools to staging directories\n\n**Example ShimCache entries**:\n```\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\vssadmin.exe  (Legitimate location)\nC:\\Temp\\vssadmin.exe              (Copied for malicious use)\nC:\\Temp\\wbadmin.exe\nC:\\Temp\\bcdedit.exe\n```\n\n**Why attackers copy tools**:\n1. Avoid EDR detection (System32 execution monitored, Temp\\ less so)\n2. Modify command-line arguments (delete shadow copies, disable recovery)\n3. Staging area for batch script execution\n\n**Detection strategy**:\n- Filter ShimCache for legitimate tool names (vssadmin, wbadmin, bcdedit, cipher) in non-standard paths\n- Check Last Modified Times (should match original if copied)\n- Correlate with Prefetch (command-line arguments reveal intent)\n\n**Real-world case - 2022 Lockbit Ransomware**:\n\nShimCache revealed:\n```\nC:\\Temp\\vssadmin.exe → LastModified: 2018-04-12 (matches System32 original)\nC:\\Temp\\wbadmin.exe  → LastModified: 2018-04-12\nC:\\Temp\\cipher.exe   → LastModified: 2018-04-12\n```\n\nPrefetch analysis:\n```\nvssadmin.exe → Command line: \"delete shadows /all /quiet\"\nwbadmin.exe  → Command line: \"delete catalog -quiet\"\ncipher.exe   → Command line: \"/w:C:\\\" (overwrite free space)\n```\n\nConclusion: Attacker copied Windows tools to Temp\\, then executed them to delete backups, shadow copies, and free space before encryption.\n\n---\n\n## Part 4: Building Execution Timelines\n\n### ShimCache Chronology\n\n**Cache Entry Position** (0-1023) provides RELATIVE chronology:\n- Position 0 = most recent\n- Position 1023 = oldest (about to be purged)\n\n**Important**: The order is based on when Windows CHECKED the file for compatibility, not when it was executed.\n\n**Example timeline** (positions 0-5):\n```\n0. C:\\Users\\Public\\malware.exe        (Most recent)\n1. C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe\n2. C:\\Windows\\System32\\powershell.exe\n3. C:\\Temp\\tools\\mimikatz.exe\n4. \\\\DC01\\ADMIN$\\psexec.exe\n5. C:\\Users\\Alice\\Downloads\\phish.exe\n```\n\n**Interpretation**: Reading BOTTOM-TO-TOP (oldest to newest):\n1. User received phishing email, downloaded phish.exe\n2. Attacker used PsExec from DC01 for lateral movement\n3. Mimikatz dumped credentials\n4. PowerShell/CMD used for post-exploitation\n5. Final malware payload (malware.exe) executed\n\n### Combining with Other Artifacts\n\n**Multi-artifact timeline**:\n\n| Timestamp | Artifact | Finding |\n|---|---|---|\n| 14:25:00 | ShimCache | phish.exe in Downloads folder |\n| 14:27:15 | Prefetch | phish.exe executed (first run) |\n| 14:28:30 | AmCache | mimikatz.exe FirstExecuted |\n| 14:28:35 | ShimCache | mimikatz.exe in Temp\\tools |\n| 14:30:00 | Event 4688 | powershell.exe process creation |\n| 14:30:05 | ShimCache | powershell.exe |\n| 14:32:00 | Prefetch | malware.exe executed |\n| 14:32:15 | ShimCache | malware.exe in Users\\Public |\n\n**Pattern recognition**: ShimCache entries often appear AFTER execution artifacts because Windows may delay compatibility checks until next reboot or Explorer refresh.\n\n---\n\n## Part 5: Advanced Anti-Forensics Detection\n\n### ShimCache Manipulation\n\n**Technique 1: Cache Clearing**\n\nAttackers delete the AppCompatCache Registry value to erase history.\n\n**Detection**:\n- Check SYSTEM transaction logs (LOG1/LOG2) for deleted values\n- Compare with Volume Shadow Copies (earlier ShimCache state)\n- Look for reg.exe or PowerShell Prefetch (Registry modification tools)\n\n**Technique 2: Selective Entry Removal**\n\nSophisticated attackers parse ShimCache binary structure and remove specific entries.\n\n**Detection**:\n- Cache entry positions may show gaps (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 5, 6 - missing 3-4)\n- Last Write Time of AppCompatCache key is suspiciously recent\n- Compare total entry count with expected based on system activity\n\n**Technique 3: Timestamp Manipulation**\n\nModify file Last Modified times before Windows caches them.\n\n**Detection**:\n- Cross-reference with MFT $FILE_NAME timestamps (harder to modify)\n- Compare ShimCache times with AmCache (independent timestamp source)\n- Check for mismatched file creation vs. modification times (modification before creation = impossible)\n\n### When ShimCache Survives Deletion\n\nEven if malware is deleted from disk:\n- ShimCache entry persists (Registry artifact, independent of filesystem)\n- File path, last modified time preserved\n- Enables identification of deleted malware\n\n**Example**:\n```\nShimCache: C:\\Users\\Public\\ransomware.exe (LastModified: 2024-03-15)\nFilesystem: File not found (deleted after encryption)\n```\n\n**Follow-up**:\n- Search MFT for deleted entry (may show original birth time, file size)\n- Check Recycle Bin ($I files) for permanent deletion timestamp\n- File carving from unallocated space to recover executable\n\n---\n\n## Part 6: Real-World Case Study\n\n### Case: 2023 APT28 (Fancy Bear) Lateral Movement\n\n**Background**: Russian APT compromised government contractor network.\n\n**Initial Discovery**: EDR detected suspicious PowerShell execution but no malware found.\n\n**ShimCache Analysis** (extracted from domain controller SYSTEM hive):\n\n```\nPosition 0:  C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\nPosition 1:  \\\\10.30.50.15\\ADMIN$\\PsExec64.exe\nPosition 2:  \\\\10.30.50.15\\ADMIN$\\procdump64.exe\nPosition 3:  \\\\10.30.50.15\\ADMIN$\\mimikatz.exe\nPosition 4:  \\\\FileServer01\\IT_Tools\\adexplorer.exe\nPosition 5:  C:\\Windows\\Temp\\update.exe\nPosition 12: C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Desktop\\backup.zip\n```\n\n**Correlation with Prefetch**:\n\n- **powershell.exe**: Prefetch shows 47 runs (post-exploitation activity)\n- **PsExec64.exe**: NO Prefetch (executed from UNC path)\n- **procdump64.exe**: NO Prefetch (memory dumping from network share)\n- **mimikatz.exe**: NO Prefetch (credential theft from network share)\n- **update.exe**: Prefetch shows 1 run (dropped payload)\n\n**Event Log Correlation**:\n\n- Event 4624 (Network Logon Type 3): Source IP 10.30.50.15 at 08:45:00\n- Event 4688 (Process Creation): powershell.exe at 08:47:15\n- Event 5145 (Network Share Access): \\\\DC01\\ADMIN$ accessed from 10.30.50.15\n\n**Timeline Reconstruction**:\n\n```\n08:45:00 - Attacker logged in from compromised workstation (10.30.50.15)\n08:45:30 - PsExec executed from network share (ShimCache evidence, no Prefetch)\n08:46:00 - Procdump dumped LSASS memory (credential theft)\n08:46:45 - Mimikatz parsed LSASS dump (extracted credentials)\n08:47:15 - PowerShell executed (post-exploitation, lateral movement scripts)\n08:50:00 - update.exe dropped and executed (C2 beacon, Prefetch confirms)\n```\n\n**Critical finding**: WITHOUT ShimCache, the network share executions (PsExec, Procdump, Mimikatz) would have been invisible (no Prefetch, no AmCache for UNC paths). ShimCache was the ONLY filesystem artifact proving these tools were accessed.\n\n**Investigation outcome**:\n- 10.30.50.15 = initially compromised workstation (spearphishing)\n- FileServer01\\IT_Tools = attacker-created share for tool staging\n- backup.zip = exfiltrated Active Directory database (7z compressed NTDS.dit)\n\n**Containment**: Network isolated, credentials reset, implants removed across 15 compromised systems identified via ShimCache UNC path analysis.\n\n---\n\n## Part 7: Practical Analysis Workflow\n\n### Standard Operating Procedure\n\n**Step 1: Extract ShimCache**\n```cmd\nAppCompatCacheParser.exe -f \"SYSTEM\" --csv \"ShimCache_Output.csv\"\n```\n\n**Step 2: Filter for High-Risk Locations**\n\nImport CSV into Excel/PowerShell, filter for:\n```\nPath contains:\n- Users\\Public\n- Temp\n- ProgramData\n- Downloads\n- \\\\<IP>\\\n- AppData\\Local\\Temp\n- Recycle.Bin\n```\n\n**Step 3: Identify Suspicious Executables**\n\nLook for:\n- Misspelled system utilities (scvhost.exe instead of svchost.exe)\n- Office documents with .exe extensions (Invoice.pdf.exe)\n- Generic names (update.exe, setup.exe, install.exe) in non-standard paths\n- Legitimate tool names (vssadmin, wbadmin) in Temp folders\n\n**Step 4: Cross-Reference with Prefetch**\n\nFor each suspicious ShimCache entry:\n```cmd\nPECmd.exe -d \"C:\\Windows\\Prefetch\" --csv \"Prefetch_Output.csv\"\n```\n\nMatch executable names, check:\n- Last Run Times (execution proof)\n- Run Counts (frequency of execution)\n- Volume Serial Numbers (USB devices, network shares)\n\n**Step 5: Correlation Table**\n\n| Executable | ShimCache Timestamp | Prefetch Last Run | AmCache FirstExecuted | Conclusion |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| malware.exe | 2024-03-15 14:30 | 2024-03-15 14:32 | 2024-03-15 14:32 | Executed (confirmed) |\n| tool.exe | 2024-03-15 10:00 | Not found | Not found | Existence only (no execution proof) |\n| psexec.exe (UNC) | 2024-03-15 09:00 | Not found | Not found | Network execution (Prefetch limitation) |\n\n**Step 6: Timeline Visualization**\n\nCreate master timeline in Timeline Explorer or Excel:\n- Sort by timestamp (chronological order)\n- Color-code by artifact type (ShimCache = blue, Prefetch = green, AmCache = red)\n- Highlight suspicious entries\n\n---\n\n## Closing: ShimCache is Your Silent Forensic Ally\n\nYou've mastered ShimCache forensics. You now understand:\n\n✅ ShimCache proves file EXISTENCE, not definitive execution\n✅ Network share executions (UNC paths) appear in ShimCache but NOT Prefetch\n✅ Windows 10 stores 1,024 entries (purges oldest when full)\n✅ ShimCache survives file deletion (Registry artifact)\n✅ Correlation with Prefetch, AmCache, BAM/DAM proves execution\n✅ Suspicious file paths (Temp, Public, ProgramData) indicate malware staging\n✅ Copied legitimate tools (vssadmin in Temp) signal ransomware preparation\n\n**Your competitive advantage**: Many investigators stop at Prefetch analysis and miss network share executions, deleted malware, and early-stage reconnaissance. ShimCache reveals what others miss.\n\n**Next lesson**: **AmCache Analysis** - Learn how to extract SHA-1 hashes, installation timestamps, and VirusTotal correlation for malware identification.\n\n**Practice challenge**: Download a forensic image (NIST CFReDS), extract ShimCache, find 3 suspicious executables, and correlate with Prefetch to build an attack timeline.\n\nYou're building an unstoppable execution artifact analysis skillset.

The user reported unexpected popups and slow performance. You've collected:\n- SYSTEM Registry hive\n- Prefetch directory\n- AmCache.hve\n\n### Evidence: ShimCache Extraction Output\n\n```csv\nCacheEntryPosition,Path,LastModifiedTimeUTC\n0,C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe,2019-12-07 10:15:32\n1,C:\\Users\\Alice\\Downloads\\March_Invoice.pdf.exe,2024-03-18 09:45:22\n2,C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe,2019-12-07 10:15:32\n3,C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\update.exe,2024-03-18 09:47:15\n4,C:\\Temp\\vssadmin.exe,2018-04-12 06:13:18\n5,\\\\10.50.30.20\\Share\\mimikatz.exe,2023-08-15 14:30:00\n6,C:\\Windows\\Temp\\chrome_installer.exe,2024-03-18 09:46:30\n7,C:\\Windows\\System32\\vssadmin.exe,2018-04-12 06:13:18\n8,C:\\ProgramData\\WindowsUpdate\\wuaueng.exe,2024-03-18 09:48:00\n9,C:\\Windows\\System32\\svchost.exe,2019-12-07 10:15:32\n10,C:\\Users\\Alice\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\setup.exe,2024-03-18 09:44:55\n```\n\n### Prefetch Evidence\n\n```\nMARCH_INVOICE.PDF.EXE-12AB34CD.pf\n  Last Run: 2024-03-18 09:45:30\n  Run Count: 1\n  \nUPDATE.EXE-56EF78GH.pf\n  Last Run: 2024-03-18 09:47:20\n  Run Count: 1\n  \nPOWERSHELL.EXE-A1B2C3D4.pf\n  Last Run: 2024-03-18 09:47:45\n  Run Count: 23\n  \nWUAUENG.EXE-E5F6G7H8.pf\n  Last Run: 2024-03-18 09:48:15\n  Run Count: 1\n```\n\n### Tasks\n\n**Task 1: Identify Suspicious Executables**\n\nReview the ShimCache entries and flag ALL suspicious files. For each, explain WHY it's suspicious.\n\n**Task 2: Execution Confirmation**\n\nFor each suspicious file, determine if it EXECUTED (not just existed) by correlating with Prefetch. Create a table:\n\n| File | ShimCache? | Prefetch? | Executed? | Evidence |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n\n**Task 3: Timeline Reconstruction**\n\nBuild a chronological timeline of the attack using ShimCache positions (0=newest) and Prefetch Last Run times. Format:\n\n```\nTime | Artifact | Event | Interpretation\n```\n\n**Task 4: Identify Attack Vector**\n\nBased on the evidence, determine:\n1. How did the attacker gain initial access?\n2. What was the infection chain (sequence of executable execution)?\n3. Which file was likely the INITIAL PAYLOAD (first malicious file)?\n\n**Task 5: Detect Anti-Forensics**\n\nYou notice:\n- ShimCache position 5: `\\\\10.50.30.20\\Share\\mimikatz.exe`\n- Prefetch: NO entry for mimikatz.exe\n- AmCache: NO entry for mimikatz.exe\n\nExplain this discrepancy. Is this normal? What additional artifacts would you check?\n\n**Task 6: Legitimate Tool Abuse**\n\nCompare entries 4 and 7:\n- Entry 4: `C:\\Temp\\vssadmin.exe` (LastModified: 2018-04-12)\n- Entry 7: `C:\\Windows\\System32\\vssadmin.exe` (LastModified: 2018-04-12)\n\nWhat does this indicate? What would you check next to confirm malicious intent?\n\n### Answers\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to reveal answers</summary>\n\n**Task 1: Suspicious Files**\n\n1. **March_Invoice.pdf.exe** (Position 1)\n   - **Why**: Double extension (.pdf.exe) = social engineering to make user think it's a PDF\n   - **Location**: Downloads folder = likely phishing attachment\n   - **Risk**: HIGH - Initial infection vector\n\n2. **update.exe** (Position 3)\n   - **Why**: Generic name in Users\\Public\\Documents = malware staging area\n   - **Location**: Public folder = world-writable, no admin needed\n   - **Risk**: HIGH - Dropped payload\n\n3. **vssadmin.exe** in C:\\Temp (Position 4)\n   - **Why**: Legitimate Windows tool in non-standard location\n   - **Purpose**: Likely copied to delete shadow copies (ransomware preparation)\n   - **Risk**: HIGH - Anti-forensics / data destruction\n\n4. **mimikatz.exe** (Position 5)\n   - **Why**: Known credential theft tool\n   - **Location**: Network share UNC path = lateral movement\n   - **Risk**: CRITICAL - Credential dumping\n\n5. **chrome_installer.exe** in Windows\\Temp (Position 6)\n   - **Why**: Suspicious location (legitimate Chrome installer would be in Downloads or Program Files)\n   - **Purpose**: Likely fake installer (malware impersonating Chrome)\n   - **Risk**: HIGH - Trojan\n\n6. **wuaueng.exe** in ProgramData\\WindowsUpdate (Position 8)\n   - **Why**: Mimics legitimate Windows Update service (wuaueng.exe normally in System32)\n   - **Location**: ProgramData = malware impersonation tactic\n   - **Risk**: CRITICAL - Persistent backdoor\n\n7. **setup.exe** in AppData\\Local\\Temp (Position 10)\n   - **Why**: Generic name in Temp folder\n   - **Purpose**: Likely malware installer or dropper\n   - **Risk**: HIGH - Initial stage malware\n\n**Task 2: Execution Confirmation**\n\n| File | ShimCache?

is it also compromised?)\n- Check if Share\\mimikatz.exe is still on that system\n- Review network traffic logs for connections between this workstation and 10.50.30.20\n\n**Task 6: Legitimate Tool Abuse**\n\n**Indication**: Attacker COPIED vssadmin.exe from System32 to C:\\Temp\n\n**Evidence**:\n- Both entries have IDENTICAL Last Modified times (2018-04-12 06:13:18)\n- This proves the file was COPIED (preserves timestamps), not created new\n\n**Malicious intent confirmed by**:\n1. **Check Prefetch for C:\\Temp\\vssadmin.exe**:\n   ```\n   VSSADMIN.EXE-XXXXXXXX.pf\n   Command line: \"vssadmin delete shadows /all /quiet\"\n   ```\n   - `/all /quiet` = delete ALL shadow copies without confirmation\n   - Classic ransomware preparation\n\n2. **Check Event Logs**:\n   - Event 4688 (Process Creation): C:\\Temp\\vssadmin.exe with command-line arguments\n   - Event 7036 (Service State Change): Volume Shadow Copy service stopped\n\n3. **Check AmCache**:\n   - FirstExecuted timestamp for C:\\Temp\\vssadmin.exe\n   - SHA-1 hash (should match legitimate System32 version)\n\n4. **Check Registry**:\n   - `HKLM\\SYSTEM\\...\\Services\\VSS\\Start` value (should be 3 = Manual)\n   - If set to 4 (Disabled), confirms attacker disabled service\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a clear ransomware preparation indicator. Attacker copied Windows recovery tools to staging directory to delete backups before encryption.\n\n</details>\n\n### Learning Takeaway\n\nThis exercise demonstrates:\n1. **Multi-artifact correlation** is essential (ShimCache + Prefetch + AmCache)\n2. **File locations** are critical indicators (Temp, Public, ProgramData = high risk)\n3. **UNC paths** in ShimCache reveal lateral movement that Prefetch misses\n4. **Legitimate tools** in unusual locations signal advanced attacks\n5. **Timeline analysis** reveals attack progression and infection chain\n\nPractice this workflow on every investigation—it's the foundation of execution artifact analysis.\n"
