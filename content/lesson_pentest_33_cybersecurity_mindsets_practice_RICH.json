Mindset determines whether technical skill is useful. This lesson shows how to cultivate mindsets that balance offensive curiosity with defensive responsibility.\n\nYou'll map the official materials, create a Kali workspace that can survive repeated experiments, and prove that the VPN path into the lab actually works before you sit for a scheduled session."
