      "question": "Your SIEM generates 10,000 alerts per day, but your security team can only investigate 100. What is this problem called, and how would you address it?",
      "correct_answer": "Alert fatigue. Address by: 1) Tune alert thresholds (reduce low-value alerts), 2) Implement severity-based prioritization (focus on HIGH/CRITICAL), 3) Automate triage of common alerts, 4) Correlate related alerts into single incidents, 5) Regularly review and disable noisy rules.",
      "explanation": "Alert fatigue occurs when too many alerts desensitize security teams, causing them to miss real threats. Solutions include: Tuning (adjust thresholds - e.g., 'failed login' alert after 10 attempts instead of 1), Prioritization (only page for CRITICAL, email for HIGH, ticket for MEDIUM), Automation (use SOAR to automatically investigate common alerts like password resets), Correlation (100 failed logins from same IP = 1 incident, not 100 alerts), Review (monthly analysis - which alerts never led to incidents? Disable them). Goal: Signal-to-noise ratio improvement.",

      "question": "You need to detect lateral movement in your network. What logs would you correlate, and what pattern would indicate an attack?",
      "correct_answer": "Correlate: Windows Security Event ID 4624 (successful logon) across multiple servers within short timeframe, check logon type 3 (network) or 10 (RDP), same source IP/username. Pattern: User account authenticating to 10+ servers in 5 minutes = lateral movement.",
      "explanation": "Lateral movement detection requires correlation across systems. Key logs: Windows Event ID 4624 (successful logon - shows who logged in, from where, logon type), 4648 (logon with explicit credentials - attacker using stolen creds), 4672 (admin privileges assigned). Attack pattern: Normal admin might access 2-3 servers per day. Attacker with compromised admin creds accesses 10-20 servers in minutes (automated tools like PSExec, WMI). SIEM correlation rule: 'If user X authenticates to > 5 unique servers in < 10 minutes, alert.' Additional indicators: Logon type 3 (network logon - PSExec), unusual source IPs, authentication outside business hours, access to servers user typically doesn't touch.",

        "Only monitoring failed logins (attackers with valid creds succeed)",
        "Not correlating across systems (looks normal per-server)",

      "question": "Your compliance officer asks how long to retain security logs. You have PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and SOX requirements. What retention periods do you implement?",
      "correct_answer": "Implement longest requirement: PCI-DSS requires 1 year online + 3 months readily available = 15 months total. HIPAA requires 6 years. SOX requires 7 years. Therefore: Retain all security logs for 7 years (SOX), with hot storage (SIEM) for 15 months (PCI-DSS), cold storage (archive) for remaining years.",
      "explanation": "Compliance frameworks have different retention requirements. PCI-DSS (credit card data): 1 year of audit logs immediately accessible, HIPAA (healthcare): 6 years minimum (some states require more), SOX (financial): 7 years for audit trails, GDPR (Europe): Varies but typically 3 months to 1 year. When multiple frameworks apply, use longest retention period. Storage strategy: Hot storage (SIEM - expensive, fast access) for short term (1-2 years), Cold storage (S3 Glacier, tape - cheap, slow access) for long term. Example architecture: 15 months in Splunk (PCI-DSS), 15 months to 7 years in S3 Glacier (SOX).",

        "title": "Why Security Monitoring Matters: You Can't Protect What You Can't See",
        "text": "Imagine a bank with no cameras, no guards, no alarm system. Robberies would go unnoticed for days. That's what happens when organizations don't monitor their IT systems. Security monitoring is the practice of continuously collecting, analyzing, and responding to security-relevant events.\n\nThe Fundamental Problem:\n\nAttackers operate in stealth. They:\n- Gain initial access (phishing email, vulnerability exploit)\n- Maintain persistence (backdoor, scheduled task)\n- Escalate privileges (exploit, credential theft)\n- Move laterally (compromise more systems)\n- Exfiltrate data (steal sensitive information)\n- Cover tracks (delete logs, use legitimate tools)\n\nWithout monitoring, organizations discover breaches months later - often from third parties (FBI, customers, media).\n\nStatistics:\n- Average time to detect breach: 207 days (IBM 2023)\n- Average time to contain breach: 73 days\n- Organizations with mature monitoring: 49 days detection time\n- Cost of breach detected in < 200 days: $3.61M\n- Cost of breach detected in > 200 days: $4.87M\n\nFaster detection = lower costs. Monitoring enables faster detection.\n\nWhat is Security Logging?\n\nLogging is the process of recording events that happen in systems, applications, and networks. Every action leaves a trail:\n\n- User logs in → Log entry created\n- File accessed → Log entry created\n- Network connection → Log entry created\n- Configuration changed → Log entry created\n\nLogs answer critical questions:\n- Who accessed what?\n- When did it happen?\n- From where (IP address, location)?\n- Was it successful?\n- What changed?\n\nTypes of Logs:\n\n1. Operating System Logs:\n- Windows: Event Viewer (Security, System, Application logs)\n- Linux: syslog, auth.log, kern.log\n- Records: Logins, logouts, service starts/stops, errors\n\n2. Application Logs:\n- Web servers: Apache access.log, IIS logs\n- Databases: MySQL query logs, SQL Server audit logs\n- Email: Mail server logs (Exchange, Postfix)\n- Records: Application errors, user actions, transactions\n\n3. Security Device Logs:\n- Firewall logs: Blocked/allowed connections\n- IDS/IPS logs: Detected attacks\n- Antivirus logs: Malware detections\n- VPN logs: Remote access connections\n\n4. Network Device Logs:\n- Router/Switch logs: Network events, configuration changes\n- DNS logs: Domain name resolutions\n- DHCP logs: IP address assignments\n- Proxy logs: Web traffic\n\n5. Cloud Platform Logs:\n- AWS CloudTrail: API calls, configuration changes\n- Azure Activity Log: Resource management\n- GCP Cloud Audit Logs: Admin activity\n\nEach log source provides pieces of the security picture. Combining them reveals the full story.\n\nCritical Security Events to Monitor:\n\n1. Authentication Events:\n- Failed login attempts (brute force detection)\n- Successful logins (especially after multiple failures)\n- Account lockouts\n- Password changes\n- Privilege escalation (user becomes admin)\n\n2. Access Events:\n- File access (especially sensitive files)\n- Database queries (SQL injection attempts)\n- Administrative actions\n- Permission changes\n\n3. Network Events:\n- Firewall denies (blocked attack attempts)\n- Port scans (reconnaissance)\n- Large data transfers (exfiltration)\n- Connections to suspicious IPs\n\n4. System Events:\n- Service starts/stops (malware persistence)\n- New scheduled tasks (persistence mechanism)\n- Registry changes (Windows persistence)\n- New user accounts created\n\n5. Security Tool Events:\n- Antivirus detections\n- IDS/IPS alerts\n- DLP (Data Loss Prevention) violations\n- EDR alerts\n\nThe Challenge: Log Volume\n\nLarge organizations generate terabytes of logs daily:\n- 10,000 employees × 100 events per day = 1 million events\n- 100 servers × 10,000 events per day = 1 million events\n- 1,000 network devices × 1,000 events per day = 1 million events\n\nTotal: 3 million events per day.\n\nHuman analysts cannot manually review millions of events. Solution: Automated tools.\n\nIntroduction to SIEM:\n\nSIEM = Security Information and Event Management\n\nSIEM systems:\n1. Collect logs from all sources (servers, firewalls, applications)\n2. Normalize logs (convert different formats to common format)\n3. Correlate events (connect related events across systems)\n4. Analyze patterns (detect anomalies, known attack patterns)\n5. Alert security teams (when threats detected)\n6. Store logs (for compliance and forensics)\n\nPopular SIEM platforms:\n- Splunk (most popular, powerful, expensive)\n- IBM QRadar\n- ArcSight (Micro Focus)\n- LogRhythm\n- Elastic Stack (ELK - Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)\n- Microsoft Sentinel (cloud-native)\n- Sumo Logic\n\nHow SIEM Detects Attacks:\n\nExample - Brute Force Detection:\n\n1. Firewall sends log: Failed SSH login from 203.0.113.50 to server1\n2. SIEM receives log, increments counter for 203.0.113.50\n3. Pattern continues: Failed login attempt 2, 3, 4... 20\n4. SIEM correlation rule triggers: '20 failed logins from single IP in 5 minutes'\n5. Alert created: 'Possible SSH brute force attack from 203.0.113.50'\n6. Security analyst investigates\n\nWithout SIEM: 20 individual log entries across different systems, no correlation, no alert.\n\nWith SIEM: Correlated into single incident, automatic alert, immediate response.\n\nLog Correlation Example:\n\nAttack: Lateral movement after credential theft\n\nLogs generated:\n1. Workstation1: User 'jsmith' successful login (normal)\n2. Workstation1: Suspicious PowerShell execution (Mimikatz - credential theft)\n3. Server1: User 'admin' successful login from Workstation1 IP (stolen admin creds)\n4. Server2: User 'admin' successful login from Server1 IP (lateral movement)\n5. Server3: User 'admin' successful login from Server1 IP (lateral movement)\n6. Server3: Large file copy to external IP (data exfiltration)\n\nWithout correlation: 6 separate events, all look normal individually.\n\nWith SIEM correlation: Pattern detected -\n- PowerShell execution + multiple admin logins within minutes + data exfiltration\n- Alert: 'Possible credential theft and lateral movement'\n\nThis is why SIEM is critical. Humans can't connect these dots across thousands of daily events.\n\nThe Detection Pyramid:\n\nSecurity monitoring operates at different levels:\n\n1. Known Bad (Signatures):\n- Detect specific malware hash\n- Detect known malicious IP address\n- Fast, accurate, but only catches known threats\n\n2. Known Good (Whitelist):\n- Allow only approved applications\n- Block everything else\n- Effective but requires maintenance\n\n3. Behavioral Anomalies:\n- User normally logs in 9am-5pm, now logging in at 3am\n- Server normally sends 10GB/day, now sending 500GB\n- Catches unknown threats, but generates false positives\n\n4. Threat Intelligence:\n- External feeds of known bad IPs, domains, malware\n- Shared indicators from security community\n- Proactive blocking\n\nEffective monitoring uses all four layers.\n\nMetrics That Matter:\n\nSecurity Operations Centers (SOCs) track:\n\n1. Mean Time to Detect (MTTD):\n- How long from attack start to detection?\n- Goal: < 1 hour for critical systems\n\n2. Mean Time to Respond (MTTR):\n- How long from detection to containment?\n- Goal: < 30 minutes for active attacks\n\n3. False Positive Rate:\n- What % of alerts are NOT real threats?\n- Goal: < 20% (80% of alerts should be real)\n\n4. Alert Volume:\n- How many alerts per day?\n- Goal: Manageable by available staff (< 100 alerts/analyst/day)\n\n5. Coverage:\n- What % of assets are monitored?\n- Goal: 100% of critical assets\n\nThese metrics guide monitoring program maturity.\n\nThe Reality Check:\n\nMost organizations struggle with security monitoring:\n- Too many logs (terabytes per day)\n- Too many alerts (alert fatigue)\n- Not enough staff (cybersecurity skills shortage)\n- Legacy systems (can't generate logs)\n- Cost (SIEM and storage expensive)\n\nBut the alternative is worse: Undetected breaches, regulatory fines, data loss, reputation damage.\n\nThe key is starting simple and improving over time:\n1. Start with critical systems (domain controllers, databases, crown jewels)\n2. Enable basic logging (authentication, access, changes)\n3. Send to central location (syslog server or basic SIEM)\n4. Create high-confidence alerts (brute force, malware detection)\n5. Gradually expand coverage and detection rules\n\nPerfection isn't the goal. Detection is."

Windows audit logging with key security events\n2. Linux auditd for file and command monitoring\n3. Centralized log collection with syslog\n4. ELK stack for log analysis\n5. Detection rules for common attacks\n\nNext step: Deploy to production systems, monitor for alerts, tune over time."

        "text": "Use these mnemonics to remember security monitoring concepts:\n\n1. Why We Log: 'WWTW'\nW - Who (user identification)\nW - What (action performed)\nT - Time (when it happened)\nW - Where (source IP, system)\n\nEvery security log should answer these questions\n\n2. Log Sources: 'OSANS'\nO - Operating System (Windows Event Log, syslog)\nS - Security devices (firewall, IDS)\nA - Applications (web server, database)\nN - Network devices (router, switch, DNS)\nS - (Cloud) Services (AWS CloudTrail, Azure Log)\n\n3. Windows Event IDs: '4-6-2-5'\n4624 - Successful logon\n4625 - Failed logon\n4672 - Admin privileges assigned\n4648 - Explicit credentials (runas)\n\nThese 4 detect authentication attacks\n\n4. SIEM Functions: 'CNCAS'\nC - Collect (gather logs from sources)\nN - Normalize (convert to common format)\nC - Correlate (connect related events)\nA - Analyze (detect patterns)\nS - Store (retention for compliance)\n\n5. Detection Pyramid: 'KGBA'\nK - Known bad (signatures)\nG - (Known) Good (whitelist)\nB - Behavioral anomalies\nA - (Threat intelligence) aggregation\n\nUse all four layers for defense in depth\n\n6. SOC Metrics: 'MTTR-FAC'\nM - MTTD (Mean Time To Detect)\nT - MTTR (Mean Time To Respond)\nT - (False positive rate)\nR - (Alert volume)\nF - (False positive rate)\nA - Alert volume\nC - Coverage (% of assets monitored)\n\n7. Alert Fatigue Solutions: 'TPAC-R'\nT - Tune thresholds (reduce noisy alerts)\nP - Prioritize by severity (focus on HIGH/CRITICAL)\nA - Automate triage (SOAR)\nC - Correlate related alerts\nR - Review regularly (disable ineffective rules)\n\n8. Linux Log Locations:\nMemory Hook: '/var/log/ for all'\n- /var/log/auth.log (authentication)\n- /var/log/syslog (general system)\n- /var/log/audit/audit.log (auditd)\n\n9. Lateral Movement Detection: '4624-Fast-Many'\n4624 - Event ID for successful logon\nFast - Multiple logins in short time\nMany - Across many systems\n\nPattern: User authenticates to 10+ systems in 5 minutes = lateral movement\n\n10. Compliance Retention: 'PHiS-7'\nP - PCI-DSS: 1 year online + 3 months archive\nH - HIPAA: 6 years minimum\nS - SOX: 7 years\n\nUse longest retention (7 years for SOX)\n\n11. Common Attack Patterns: 'BLPD'\nB - Brute force (many failed logins)\nL - Lateral movement (logons across systems)\nP - Privilege escalation (normal user becomes admin)\nD - Data exfiltration (large data transfers)\n\n12. ELK Stack: 'Elasticsearch-Logstash-Kibana'\nE - Elasticsearch (storage and search)\nL - Logstash (log processing)\nK - Kibana (visualization)\n\n13. Account Events to Monitor: 'CELLD'\nC - Created (new account = persistence)\nE - Enabled (disabled account activated)\nL - Locked (brute force indicator)\nL - (Password changed)\nD - Deleted (covering tracks)\n\n14. Network Events: 'CDPB'\nC - Connections to suspicious IPs\nD - Denied connections (firewall blocks)\nP - Port scans (reconnaissance)\nB - (Large data transfers) Bandwidth spikes\n\n15. Auditd Keys: 'PSDN'\nP - passwd_changes (user/group modifications)\nS - sudo_execution (privilege escalation)\nD - delete (file deletion)\nN - network_connections (suspicious connections)\n\nVisual Memory Technique:\n\nPicture a security camera system:\n- Cameras (log sources) everywhere\n- Recording continuously (logging)\n- Central monitoring room (SIEM)\n- Security guard watches screens (analyst)\n- Alarms for suspicious activity (alerts)\n- Video archive for investigations (log retention)\n\n16. Critical Windows Events: '1102'\n1102 - Security log cleared\n\nSingle most important event (attacker covering tracks)\n\n17. Syslog Severity Levels: 'EACEWNID'\nE - Emergency (0)\nA - Alert (1)\nC - Critical (2)\nE - Error (3)\nW - Warning (4)\nN - Notice (5)\nI - Informational (6)\nD - Debug (7)\n\n18. Log Collection: 'TCP not UDP'\nTCP - Reliable (confirms delivery)\nUDP - Fast but unreliable (can lose logs)\n\nUse TCP (@@) for security logs, UDP (@) for less critical\n\n19. False Positive Reduction: 'BWC'\nB - Baseline (understand normal behavior)\nW - Whitelist (exclude known good)\nC - Context (add business context to rules)\n\n20. SIEM Selection: 'CSPS'\nC - Cost (licensing, storage)\nS - Scalability (handles log volume?)\nP - Performance (query speed)\nS - (Support and) Skills (team expertise)\n\nMemory Hook for Event Correlation:\n'Connect the Dots'\n- Individual events = dots\n- Correlation = drawing lines between dots\n- Pattern emerges = attack detected\n\nExample: Failed login (dot) + Successful login (dot) + File access (dot) + Large download (dot) = Connected = Attack"

        "title": "Building a Security Monitoring Mindset",
        "text": "Security monitoring can feel overwhelming. Millions of log events. Thousands of alerts. Systems you've never heard of. It's easy to feel lost in the noise.\n\nBut here's the truth: Every security professional started exactly where you are. Confused by logs. Overwhelmed by alerts. Unsure what matters.\n\nThe difference between those who succeed and those who give up? They embraced the learning curve and started small.\n\nThe Mindset Shift:\n\nBeginner thinking:\n'I need to monitor everything perfectly from day one.'\n'Every log is equally important.'\n'I should never miss an alert.'\n\nExpert thinking:\n'Start with critical systems and expand gradually.'\n'Some logs are 10x more valuable than others.'\n'Some alerts aren't worth investigating - tune them out.'\n\nYou're not building perfection. You're building detection capability, one log source at a time.\n\nThe 80/20 Rule in Security Monitoring:\n\n80% of breaches can be detected with 20% of log sources:\n- Windows Security Event Log (authentication, privilege escalation)\n- Firewall logs (network connections, blocked attacks)\n- VPN logs (remote access)\n- Critical server logs (databases, domain controllers)\n- Antivirus/EDR logs (malware detection)\n\nStart there. Master those. Then expand.\n\nFrom Overwhelming to Actionable:\n\nYour first day: Enable logging on domain controllers and critical servers. Just authentication events (Event ID 4624, 4625). That's it.\n\nYour first week: Set up central log collection (syslog server or basic ELK). Send authentication logs from 10 systems.\n\nYour first month: Create first detection rule - 'Alert if > 20 failed logins from single IP in 5 minutes.' Tune based on false positives.\n\nYour first quarter: Add firewall logs. Create rule for 'Port scan detection' (connections to > 20 ports from single IP).\n\nYour first year: 20 log sources, 15 detection rules, catching real attacks.\n\nYou didn't start with perfect monitoring. You built it incrementally.\n\nThe Career Progression:\n\nJunior SOC Analyst ($50-70K):\n- Reviews alerts from SIEM\n- Investigates suspected incidents\n- Escalates confirmed threats\n\nSOC Analyst ($70-95K):\n- Creates detection rules\n- Tunes alerts (reduces false positives)\n- Performs threat hunting\n\nSenior SOC Analyst / Detection Engineer ($95-130K):\n- Designs monitoring architecture\n- Integrates new log sources\n- Optimizes SIEM performance\n- Trains junior analysts\n\nSOC Manager / Principal Engineer ($130-180K):\n- Manages SOC operations\n- Defines metrics and KPIs\n- Vendor selection\n- Budget management\n\nThe path from junior to senior? Learning by doing. Every alert you investigate teaches you. Every false positive you tune improves the system. Every real incident you detect builds expertise.\n\nThe Skills You're Building:\n\nYou're learning:\n- Log analysis (reading raw events)\n- Pattern recognition (spotting anomalies)\n- Critical thinking (real threat vs false positive?)\n- Automation (tuning rules to reduce noise)\n- Communication (explaining findings to non-technical stakeholders)\n\nThese aren't just security skills. They're problem-solving skills that apply everywhere.\n\nThe Hard Truth About Alert Fatigue:\n\nEvery SOC analyst has been there:\n- 10,000 alerts in queue\n- 90% are false positives\n- Real attacks buried in noise\n- Feeling overwhelmed and ineffective\n\nThe solution isn't working harder. It's working smarter:\n- Tune aggressively (if alert never found real attack, disable it)\n- Prioritize by severity (only page for CRITICAL)\n- Automate common investigations (SOAR)\n- Accept imperfection (100% detection is impossible)\n\nYour goal: Maximize signal-to-noise ratio. Fewer, better alerts.\n\nThe Confidence Builder:\n\nYou've now learned:\n- Why security monitoring matters (detect breaches faster)\n- What logs to collect (OS, application, network, security devices)\n- How SIEM works (collect, normalize, correlate, alert)\n- Key detection patterns (brute force, lateral movement, privilege escalation)\n- Practical configuration (Windows audit policy, Linux auditd, syslog)\n\nThat's more than 70% of IT professionals know about security monitoring.\n\nThe Practical Challenge:\n\nThis week:\n1. Enable Windows audit policy on your test system\n2. Generate 10 failed login attempts (intentionally)\n3. Find those events in Event Viewer (Event ID 4625)\n4. Bonus: Set up ELK stack and send logs to it\n\nDoing this ONCE transforms 'I've read about logging' into 'I've configured logging.'\n\nThe Reality Check:\n\nOrganizations struggle with monitoring because:\n- It's complex (many moving parts)\n- It's expensive (SIEM licenses, storage)\n- It requires skills (log analysis, detection engineering)\n- It's never 'done' (continuous tuning)\n\nBut those challenges create opportunity. Organizations desperately need people who can:\n- Configure logging properly\n- Integrate log sources into SIEM\n- Write effective detection rules\n- Investigate alerts efficiently\n- Reduce false positives\n\nEvery organization needs these skills. Few people have them. That's your opportunity.\n\nThe Bigger Picture:\n\nYou're learning fundamentals:\n- Fundamentals of authentication and authorization\n- Fundamentals of encryption\n- Fundamentals of network security\n- Fundamentals of security monitoring\n\nThese are the building blocks. Every advanced topic (malware analysis, penetration testing, incident response, cloud security) builds on these fundamentals.\n\nMaster fundamentals → Everything else becomes easier.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nYou're ready for:\n- Specialized domains (DFIR, Malware, Active Directory, Pentest, Red Team, Blue Team)\n- Cloud security (monitoring AWS, Azure, GCP)\n- Advanced detection engineering\n- Threat hunting\n- Incident response\n\nEvery path requires the monitoring fundamentals you just learned.\n\nFinal Thought:\n\nSecurity monitoring isn't about seeing everything. It's about seeing what matters.\n\nYou don't need to monitor every log. You need to monitor the logs that detect attacks.\n\nYou don't need to alert on everything. You need to alert on things analysts can act on.\n\nYou don't need perfect detection. You need better detection than yesterday.\n\nThat's the mindset of effective security monitoring.\n\nKeep learning. Keep building. Keep detecting.\n\nSee you in the advanced lessons."

        "text": "Reflect on your understanding of security monitoring and logging:\n\n1. Core Concepts:\n- Why can't organizations rely on manual log review? What makes automation necessary?\n- Explain the difference between logging and monitoring in one sentence each.\n- What are the four questions every security log should answer? (Hint: Who, What, When, Where)\n\n2. Log Sources:\n- Name three types of logs and what security events each detects.\n- Which Windows Event ID indicates a successful login? Failed login? Admin privilege assignment?\n- What Linux log file contains authentication events? Where is it located?\n\n3. SIEM Understanding:\n- What does SIEM stand for, and what are its five core functions?\n- How does SIEM detect brute force attacks through log correlation?\n- Why is event correlation more effective than analyzing individual logs?\n\n4. Detection Patterns:\n- Describe the log pattern that indicates lateral movement in a network.\n- What log events would you correlate to detect credential theft followed by privilege escalation?\n- How do you distinguish a legitimate admin accessing multiple servers vs an attacker?\n\n5. Alert Fatigue:\n- What is alert fatigue, and why is it dangerous?\n- You have 10,000 alerts/day but can only investigate 100. List three strategies to address this.\n- Should you alert on every failed login? Why or why not?\n\n6. Metrics and KPIs:\n- What is MTTD (Mean Time To Detect)? Why does it matter?\n- What's an acceptable false positive rate for a SOC? (Hint: < 20%)\n- How do you measure the effectiveness of your monitoring program?\n\n7. Windows Logging:\n- What PowerShell command configures Windows audit policy for logon events?\n- Why should you increase the default Windows Security log size?\n- What does Windows Event ID 1102 indicate? Why is it critical?\n\n8. Linux Logging:\n- What is auditd, and what does it monitor that syslog doesn't?\n- How do you configure Linux to forward logs to a central syslog server?\n- What's the difference between /var/log/auth.log and /var/log/syslog?\n\n9. Compliance and Retention:\n- You have PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and SOX requirements. What log retention period do you implement? Why?\n- What's the difference between 'hot' storage (SIEM) and 'cold' storage (S3 Glacier) for logs?\n- Why can't you just delete old logs to save storage costs?\n\n10. Practical Scenarios:\n- You join a company with no security monitoring. Design your first 90 days (what would you implement, in what order?)\n- Your SIEM alerts on '20 failed SSH logins from IP 203.0.113.50.' Walk through your investigation process.\n- A server shows 1000 Event ID 4624 (successful logon) in 5 minutes. Is this normal? How do you determine?\n\n11. ELK Stack:\n- What are the three components of ELK, and what does each do?\n- Why use Logstash instead of sending logs directly to Elasticsearch?\n- What is Kibana used for?\n\n12. Detection Engineering:\n- Write a pseudocode detection rule for 'user authenticates to > 10 servers in 5 minutes.'\n- How do you reduce false positives without missing real attacks?\n- What's the difference between signature-based detection and behavioral anomaly detection?\n\n13. Real-World Application:\n- The 2013 Target breach was detected by monitoring tools but alerts were ignored. What went wrong?\n- How would proper security monitoring have detected the SolarWinds attack faster?\n- Design monitoring for a small business (50 employees, 10 servers) - what's essential vs nice-to-have?\n\n14. Integration:\n- How does security monitoring integrate with incident response?\n- What logs would you send to your SIEM first (prioritization)?\n- How do you balance monitoring coverage with storage costs?\n\n15. Knowledge Gaps:\n- What concepts still feel unclear?\n- What hands-on exercise would help solidify your understanding?\n- What monitoring topic would you like to explore deeper?\n\n16. Action Items:\n- Can you enable Windows audit policy on a test system?\n- Can you query Windows Event Viewer for Event ID 4625 (failed logins)?\n- Can you explain SIEM to a non-technical friend?\n\nTake 15 minutes to write answers. The goal is to identify what you know confidently vs what needs more practice.\n\nRevisit this after configuring actual logging on a test system. Hands-on experience makes everything clearer."
