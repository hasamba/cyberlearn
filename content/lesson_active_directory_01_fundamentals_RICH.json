        "text": "Active Directory (AD) is Microsoft's directory service for Windows networks. It's a centralized database that stores information about network resources and enables administrators to manage users, computers, and security policies from one place.\n\nKey Functions:\n\n1. **Authentication**: Verifies WHO you are (username/password)\n2. **Authorization**: Determines WHAT you can access (permissions)\n3. **Centralized Management**: Admins control everything from one console\n4. **Policy Enforcement**: Security settings applied automatically across all computers\n5. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Log in once, access multiple resources\n\nWithout AD, administrators would need to create separate accounts on every single computer and server - imagine managing 10,000 computers individually!"

        "text": "A Domain Controller (DC) is a Windows Server that hosts Active Directory. It's the 'master brain' that:\n\n- Stores the AD database (containing all users, computers, groups, policies)\n- Authenticates login requests ('Is this password correct?')\n- Applies Group Policies to computers\n- Replicates data with other DCs for redundancy\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n**Domain**: A logical group of network objects (users, computers) that share the same AD database. Example: 'company.com'\n\n**Forest**: A collection of one or more domains. The top-level security boundary.\n\n**Replication**: Multiple DCs sync their databases automatically. If one DC fails, others continue working.\n\n**Why Multiple DCs?**\n- Redundancy: If one fails, others take over\n- Load balancing: Distribute authentication requests\n- Geographic distribution: DCs in different offices for faster local authentication"

      "simplified_explanation": "Think of a Domain Controller like the principal's office in a school. It has the master records of all students (users), knows which classrooms exist (computers), and enforces school rules (policies).
