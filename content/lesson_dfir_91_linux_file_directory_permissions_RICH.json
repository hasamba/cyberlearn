      "correct_answer": 1,

      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "777 (rwxrwxrwx) means everyone (user, group, others) has full permissions. This is extremely dangerous as any user can read, modify, or execute the file. It's almost never the correct permission setting.",

Initial access was through a vulnerable web application running as www-data user.\n\n## Investigation\n\nChecking for suspicious SUID binaries:\n```bash\nfind / -perm -4000 -type f -ls 2>/dev/null\n```\n\nDiscovered:\n```\n-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 16384 Oct 14 03:47 /usr/local/bin/backup\n```\n\nThis SUID binary was created by the attacker! When executed, it runs as root (due to SUID) but can be called by any user.\n\n## Attack Timeline\n\n1. Attacker exploited web app vulnerability → gained www-data shell\n2. Found world-writable directory: /usr/local/bin (misconfigured!)\n3. Compiled malicious binary with SUID bit\n4. Set as owner: root, permissions: 4755\n5. Executed binary → instant root shell\n\n## Prevention\n\nRegular permission audits:\n```bash\n# Baseline all SUID files  \nfind / -perm -4000 > suid_baseline.txt\n\n# Compare later\nfind / -perm -4000 > suid_current.txt\ndiff suid_baseline.txt suid_current.txt\n```\n\nThis breach could have been prevented by:\n- Proper directory permissions (/usr/local/bin should not be world-writable)\n- Regular SUID file auditing\n- Restricting www-data user permissions"
