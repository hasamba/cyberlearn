We describe the responsibilities, metrics,\nand collaboration patterns each role brings to the mission.\n\nMeasurement guidance covers leading indicators (shift-left behaviors, automation coverage), lagging\nindicators (reduced dwell time, audit pass rates), and qualitative signals (confidence in\nbriefings).\n\nPitfall watchlist: we flag legacy habits, tooling myths, and communication gaps that frequently\nderail progress, pairing each with countermeasures.\n\nMomentum plan: document ownership, next experiments, and knowledge-sharing touchpoints so the\ncapability matures between sprints.\n\nContinuous improvement brief 1 for AI Model Poisoning and Backdoors: capture lessons learned,\nconvert them into automation stories, socialize them with stakeholders, and schedule the next\nrehearsal so momentum compounds.\n\nContinuous improvement brief 2 for AI Model Poisoning and Backdoors: capture lessons learned,\nconvert them into automation stories, socialize them with stakeholders, and schedule the next\nrehearsal so momentum compounds.\n\nContinuous improvement brief 3 for AI Model Poisoning and Backdoors: capture lessons learned,\nconvert them into automation stories, socialize them with stakeholders, and schedule the next\nrehearsal so momentum compounds.\n\nContinuous improvement brief 4 for AI Model Poisoning and Backdoors: capture lessons learned,\nconvert them into automation stories, socialize them with stakeholders, and schedule the next\nrehearsal so momentum compounds.\n\nMastery sustainment note 1: treat AI Model Poisoning and Backdoors as a living program—broadcast\nwins, capture obstacles, invest in automation, and schedule the next rehearsal so the learning cycle\nnever stalls.\n\nMastery sustainment note 2: treat AI Model Poisoning and Backdoors as a living program—broadcast\nwins, capture obstacles, invest in automation, and schedule the next rehearsal so the learning cycle\nnever stalls.\n\nMastery sustainment note 3: treat AI Model Poisoning and Backdoors as a living program—broadcast\nwins, capture obstacles, invest in automation, and schedule the next rehearsal so the learning cycle\nnever stalls.\n\nMastery sustainment note 4: treat AI Model Poisoning and Backdoors as a living program—broadcast\nwins, capture obstacles, invest in automation, and schedule the next rehearsal so the learning cycle\nnever stalls.\n\nMastery sustainment note 5: treat AI Model Poisoning and Backdoors as a living program—broadcast\nwins, capture obstacles, invest in automation, and schedule the next rehearsal so the learning cycle\nnever stalls.\n\nMastery sustainment note 6: treat AI Model Poisoning and Backdoors as a living program—broadcast\nwins, capture obstacles, invest in automation, and schedule the next rehearsal so the learning cycle\nnever stalls.\n\nMastery sustainment note 7: treat AI Model Poisoning and Backdoors as a living program—broadcast\nwins, capture obstacles, invest in automation, and schedule the next rehearsal so the learning cycle\nnever stalls.\n\nMastery sustainment note 8: treat AI Model Poisoning and Backdoors as a living program—broadcast\nwins, capture obstacles, invest in automation, and schedule the next rehearsal so the learning cycle\nnever stalls."
