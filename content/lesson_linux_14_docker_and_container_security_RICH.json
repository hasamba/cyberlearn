Practitioners lean on auditd because Linux Audit daemon records system calls, file access, and security-relevant events for compliance and forensics. Security engineers define rules for privileged commands, monitor configuration changes, and forward logs to SIEM platforms.\nKey telemetry such as Syslog surfaces the signals teams must investigate. Syslog consolidates authentication logs, kernel messages, and application events. Analysts inspect `/var/log/secure`, `/var/log/auth.log`, and journald entries for brute force or privilege escalation.\nAdversaries repeatedly weaponize Rootkit deployment. Kernel rootkits hide processes, files, and network connections to maintain stealthy persistence. Monitor kernel module loads, verify signatures, and compare `/proc` data against trusted baselines.\nHistorical lessons from Dirty COW exploitation underline the stakes. CVE-2016-5195 allowed local privilege escalation via copy-on-write vulnerabilities. Rapid patching and kernel hardening mitigated high-impact Linux vulnerabilities.\nCommon mistake: Running containers or services as root increases impact of compromises.\n\n#### Operational guidance\nTranslate docker security best practices into practice by running scenario-based drills and documenting expected versus observed telemetry. Regularly run integrity checks with tools like AIDE or Tripwire to detect unauthorized changes.\n\n### image scanning (Trivy\nThe emphasis on image scanning (trivy within Docker and Container Security connects directly to frontline needs across the linux domain. Practitioners lean on SELinux because Security-Enhanced Linux enforces mandatory access controls using policies that confine processes and files. Administrators tune policies, analyze AVC denials, and leverage permissive mode before enforcing contexts.\nKey telemetry such as Process accounting surfaces the signals teams must investigate. acct/pacct files track command execution history with CPU usage and UID/GID context. Incident responders review unusual commands, long-running scripts, and user activity timelines.\nAdversaries repeatedly weaponize Container escape. Attackers exploit container runtime vulnerabilities to access the host. Enforce namespace isolation, monitor syscalls with Falco, and restrict privileged containers.\nHistorical lessons from CDN cryptomining incident underline the stakes.

Practitioners lean on Falco because Falco monitors kernel system calls to detect anomalous behavior on Linux hosts and containers. Teams craft Falco rules to flag suspicious process execution, privilege escalation, and data exfiltration attempts.\nKey telemetry such as Kernel security modules surfaces the signals teams must investigate. SELinux, AppArmor, and seccomp generate audit logs when policies block unauthorized actions. Engineers analyze denials to adjust policies and detect exploitation attempts.\nAdversaries repeatedly weaponize Credential harvesting. Malicious actors extract SSH keys, `/etc/shadow` hashes, or cached credentials.

Practitioners lean on OSQuery because OSQuery exposes the operating system as a relational database for security analytics. Security teams schedule queries to monitor package versions, user accounts, and loaded kernel modules.\nKey telemetry such as Package manager logs surfaces the signals teams must investigate. APT, YUM, and zypper logs reveal installation and update history.
