        "text": "### Zeek for ICS protocol analysis\nThe emphasis on zeek for ics protocol analysis within OT Network Monitoring and Detection connects directly to frontline needs across the iot security domain. Practitioners lean on Cisco Cyber Vision because Cyber Vision inventories industrial assets, monitors network behavior, and detects anomalies across OT environments. Engineers integrate with Firepower firewalls, configure segmentation policies, and alert on new device fingerprints.\nKey telemetry such as ICS protocol captures surfaces the signals teams must investigate. Modbus, DNP3, PROFINET, and OPC UA traffic reveals device interactions and command patterns. Operators baseline normal coils/register accesses, detect unauthorized write commands, and enforce whitelists.\nAdversaries repeatedly weaponize Firmware tampering. Attackers modify firmware to embed backdoors or disable safety checks. Implement code signing, monitor for unexpected firmware hashes, and maintain golden images.\nHistorical lessons from Stuxnet underline the stakes. The worm targeted Iranian centrifuges, manipulating PLC logic to cause physical damage. Defense-in-depth, code signing, and monitoring of engineering workstations are critical for OT security.\nCommon mistake: Legacy OT devices lack security agents, requiring compensating controls like network monitoring.\n\n#### Operational guidance\nTranslate zeek for ics protocol analysis into practice by running scenario-based drills and documenting expected versus observed telemetry. Establish maintenance windows and test environments to validate firmware patches before deployment.\n\n### anomaly detection in OT\nThe emphasis on anomaly detection in ot within OT Network Monitoring and Detection connects directly to frontline needs across the iot security domain. Practitioners lean on Nozomi Networks Guardian because Guardian provides deep packet inspection for ICS protocols and builds asset maps for OT networks. Analysts baseline PLC communications, detect unauthorized logic changes, and orchestrate incident response with OT staff.\nKey telemetry such as Device inventory databases surfaces the signals teams must investigate. Asset repositories track firmware versions, vendors, and communication paths. Security teams identify unsupported devices, patch gaps, and plan network segmentation.\nAdversaries repeatedly weaponize Botnet recruitment. IoT botnets such as Mirai exploit weak credentials to launch DDoS attacks. Alert on outbound scanning, default credential usage, and unusual DNS queries.\nHistorical lessons from Mirai botnet underline the stakes. Mirai infected IoT devices, launching massive DDoS attacks against Dyn DNS providers. Strong authentication, patch management, and network filtering prevent large-scale botnets.\nCommon mistake: Unmanaged remote access by vendors bypasses enterprise security policies.\n\n#### Operational guidance\nTranslate anomaly detection in ot into practice by running scenario-based drills and documenting expected versus observed telemetry. Coordinate with OT engineers to understand process constraints and design security controls that respect safety requirements.\n\n### passive monitoring\nThe emphasis on passive monitoring within OT Network Monitoring and Detection connects directly to frontline needs across the iot security domain. Practitioners lean on AWS IoT Device Defender because Device Defender audits IoT configurations, monitors metrics, and applies mitigation actions. Teams set anomaly detection models for device metrics, enforce secure TLS configurations, and automate quarantine.\nKey telemetry such as Physical access logs surfaces the signals teams must investigate. Badge readers and maintenance records correlate physical presence with configuration changes. Investigators review logs to validate authorized maintenance and detect insider threats.\nAdversaries repeatedly weaponize Lateral movement into OT networks. Compromised IT systems pivot into OT segments via poorly secured remote access. Enforce segmentation, monitor jump hosts, and inspect protocol usage crossing network zones.\nHistorical lessons from TRITON malware underline the stakes. TRITON targeted safety instrumented systems, attempting to manipulate emergency shutdown controllers. Segmentation between safety systems and engineering networks, plus strict change management, are essential.\nCommon mistake: Firmware updates often require downtime, so teams postpone them indefinitely.\n\n#### Operational guidance\nTranslate passive monitoring into practice by running scenario-based drills and documenting expected versus observed telemetry. Document vendor access procedures and monitor sessions in real time to detect anomalies.\n\n### ICS honeypots\nThe emphasis on ics honeypots within OT Network Monitoring and Detection connects directly to frontline needs across the iot security domain. Practitioners lean on Shodan and Censys because Search engines discover exposed IoT devices, revealing misconfigurations and outdated firmware. Security researchers inventory external attack surface and prioritize remediation of exposed interfaces.\nKey telemetry such as IoT cloud telemetry surfaces the signals teams must investigate. Device twins, MQTT topics, and metrics from IoT hubs expose operational status. Security teams monitor for unusual publish/subscribe patterns, certificate expirations, and latency spikes indicating compromise.\nAdversaries repeatedly weaponize Firmware tampering. Attackers modify firmware to embed backdoors or disable safety checks. Implement code signing, monitor for unexpected firmware hashes, and maintain golden images.\nHistorical lessons from Stuxnet underline the stakes. The worm targeted Iranian centrifuges, manipulating PLC logic to cause physical damage.
