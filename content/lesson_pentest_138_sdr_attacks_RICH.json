When you capture transmission N and the legitimate user presses the button again, the receiver increments its expected counter to N+1. Your replayed code N is now 'stale' and rejected. KeeLoq uses lightweight encryption (not AES-256), and frequency drift/hopping is not the primary defense. However, vulnerabilities exist: (1) Some receivers accept codes within a 'window' (e.g., N to N+256) to account for accidental button presses, enabling 'future code' attacks. (2) Side-channel attacks can recover the secret key. (3) Jamming + capture can prevent the legitimate signal from reaching the car, keeping your captured code 'fresh'."}

      "content": {"text": "🎯 **Welcome to the World of Radio Frequency (RF) Hacking!**\n\nYou're about to learn one of the most powerful—and most overlooked—skill sets in offensive security: **Software Defined Radio (SDR)** exploitation. While most pentesters focus on digital systems (web apps, networks, databases), the physical world around you is buzzing with wireless signals that control everything from garage doors to cars to industrial equipment. And most of these signals? **Completely unprotected.**\n\n**Why SDR matters for penetration testers:**\n\n- **Invisible attack surface**: RF signals are everywhere, but most organizations don't monitor or secure them\n- **Physical impact**: Unlock doors, start cars, disable alarms, manipulate industrial sensors\n- **Low barrier to entry**: $20 USB dongle (RTL-SDR) is enough to start capturing signals\n- **High-value targets**: Car key fobs, building access cards, remote controls, IoT sensors, medical devices\n- **Legal gray areas**: Many organizations don't have policies for RF testing—opening conversations about this risk\n\n**What makes SDR unique:**\n\n**Traditional radio**: Hardware-defined (AM/FM radio = specific circuit for that frequency)\n**SDR**: Software-defined (same hardware receives 24 MHz - 1.8 GHz, software decodes any protocol)\n\n**Think of it like this:**\n- **Traditional radio** = DVD player (plays only DVDs)\n- **SDR** = Computer with media software (plays DVDs, Blu-rays, streaming, VHS captures, etc.)\n\n**Your mindset shift for this lesson:**\n\nThe physical world runs on wireless signals. Every time you press a button—garage door opener, car key fob, gate remote—you're transmitting a radio signal. And if you can **capture** that signal (record it like audio), you can often **replay** it (play it back like pressing the button yourself).\n\n**This lesson will transform you from:**\n❌ \"Wireless = Wi-Fi and Bluetooth\"\n✅ \"Wireless includes the entire RF spectrum—garage doors, cars, industrial controls, IoT sensors, and thousands of proprietary protocols\"\n\n❌ \"RF hacking requires expensive equipment and electrical engineering degrees\"\n✅ \"A $20 RTL-SDR dongle and free software (GQRX, URH, GNU Radio) are enough to start capturing and replaying signals\"\n\n❌ \"If it's not on the network, I can't attack it\"\n✅ \"If it uses radio waves, it's vulnerable—and I can intercept it from 10-1000+ meters away\"\n\n**What you'll learn:**\n1. **SDR fundamentals**: What is SDR? How does it work? What hardware do you need?\n2. **RF spectrum analysis**: How to find signals in the \"radio haystack\" (spectrum analyzer, waterfall display)\n3. **Signal capture**: Recording raw RF signals (IQ data, WAV files)\n4. **Demodulation**: Converting radio waves to bits (OOK, ASK, FSK, GFSK)\n5. **Protocol reverse engineering**: Analyzing captured data to understand how devices communicate\n6. **Replay attacks**: Re-transmitting captured signals to control devices\n7. **Real-world targets**: Garage doors, car key fobs, wireless sensors, remote controls\n8. **Defenses**: Rolling codes, encryption, frequency hopping\n\n**By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:**\n- Set up an RTL-SDR and scan the RF spectrum\n- Identify and capture wireless signals (garage doors, key fobs, remotes)\n- Analyze modulation schemes (OOK, FSK, ASK)\n- Perform replay attacks on vulnerable systems\n- Reverse engineer proprietary wireless protocols\n- Recommend defenses to clients\n\nLet's unlock the invisible world of radio frequencies! 🚀"}

      "title": "Teach Me Like I'm 10: What is Software Defined Radio?",
      "content": {"text": "## 🎈 SDR Explained Like You're 10 Years Old\n\n**Imagine you have a walkie-talkie:**\n\n**Old-school walkie-talkie (traditional radio):**\n- It can ONLY talk on ONE channel (like channel 7)\n- To change channels, you turn a physical knob that changes the electronics inside\n- If you want to listen to FM radio, you need a DIFFERENT device (FM radio)\n- If you want to listen to police scanners, you need ANOTHER device (police scanner)\n- **Each device = ONE type of signal**\n\n**Software Defined Radio (SDR) = The Super Walkie-Talkie:**\n- It can listen to HUNDREDS of channels (24 MHz to 1,800 MHz!)\n- You don't change hardware—you just change the SOFTWARE on your computer\n- The SAME device can:\n  - Listen to FM radio\n  - Listen to police/fire scanners\n  - Capture garage door signals\n  - Sniff car key fob signals\n  - Monitor baby monitors\n  - Capture weather station data\n  - And thousands of other signals!\n- **One device = ALL signals (limited only by frequency range)**\n\n---\n\n## 📻 How Does a Radio Work? (Simple Version)\n\n**Step 1: Transmitter (sending a signal)**\n\nImagine you want to send a secret message across a lake:\n- You can't yell (sound doesn't travel far enough)\n- So you use a FLASHLIGHT:\n  - **ON** = \"1\" (binary digit)\n  - **OFF** = \"0\" (binary digit)\n- You blink the flashlight in a pattern: ON-OFF-ON-ON-OFF (10110)\n- Your friend across the lake sees the blinks and writes down: 10110\n\n**That's how radio works!**\n- Instead of a flashlight, you use **radio waves** (invisible light)\n- Instead of \"ON/OFF\", you transmit at a specific **frequency** (like 315 MHz)\n- The pattern of ON/OFF signals encodes your **data** (the button you pressed on the garage door remote)\n\n**Step 2: Receiver (receiving the signal)**\n\n- Your friend has a radio that \"listens\" on 315 MHz (like watching for the flashlight)\n- When they see the pattern 10110, they decode it: \"Oh, that means 'open the garage door'\"\n- The garage door motor activates\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Real-World Example: Garage Door Opener\n\n**Old garage doors (pre-1993):**\n\n1. **You press the button** on your remote\n2. **The remote transmits** a radio signal at 315 MHz (like blinking the flashlight)\n3. **The signal contains a code**: Let's say the code is \"10110101\"\n4. **This code NEVER CHANGES** (it's hardcoded into your remote)\n5. **The garage door receiver** listens on 315 MHz\n6. **When it hears \"10110101\"**, it opens the door\n\n**The hacker's view:**\n\n1. **The hacker uses an SDR** (a radio that can record signals)\n2. **They park near your house** and wait for you to open your garage\n3. **The SDR records the signal**: \"10110101\" at 315 MHz\n4. **Later, the hacker comes back** with a **transmitter** (a device that can send signals)\n5. **They replay the signal**: Transmit \"10110101\" at 315 MHz\n6. **Your garage door opens** because it heard the correct code!\n\n**Why this works:**\n- The garage door doesn't know if the signal came from YOUR remote or the HACKER's transmitter\n- The code never changes, so once captured, it works forever\n- This is called a **REPLAY ATTACK**\n\n---\n\n## 🚗 Another Example: Car Key Fob\n\n**Modern car key fobs (2000s+):**\n\nCar manufacturers learned from the garage door problem. So they use **ROLLING CODES**:\n\n1. **You press \"unlock\" on your key fob**\n2. **The fob generates a NEW code** every time (e.g., Code #1: \"10110101\", Code #2: \"11001010\", Code #3: \"10010110\")\n3. **The car knows the sequence** (it has the same secret formula as the key fob)\n4. **When the car receives Code #2**, it checks: \"Is this the next code I'm expecting? Yes! Unlock.\"\n5. **If the hacker tries to replay Code #2**, the car rejects it: \"I already used Code #2. I'm expecting Code #3 now.\"\n\n**This is MUCH more secure!**\n\nBut... hackers found a trick:\n\n**RollJam Attack (2015):**\n1. **Hacker parks near your car** with a device that **JAMS** (blocks) the signal\n2. **You press \"unlock\"** on your fob → Car doesn't unlock (the signal was jammed)\n3. **Hacker's device CAPTURES Code #1** (the signal you sent)\n4. **You press \"unlock\" AGAIN** (because it didn't work the first time) → Car still doesn't unlock\n5. **Hacker's device CAPTURES Code #2** and then **REPLAYS Code #1** to your car\n6. **Your car unlocks** (it received Code #1)\n7. **You walk away, thinking everything worked**\n8. **Later, the hacker returns** and **REPLAYS Code #2** → Your car unlocks!\n\n**Why this works:**\n- The hacker prevented your car from hearing Code #1\n- So when they replay Code #2, your car thinks it's the \"next\" code\n- This is called a **JAM-CAPTURE-REPLAY ATTACK**\n\n---\n\n## 🛡️ How to Defend Against This?\n\n**1. Use rolling codes** (modern garage doors and car key fobs)\n- Code changes every time\n- Old codes are rejected\n\n**2. Add encryption** (scramble the code so hackers can't understand it)\n- Even if they capture the signal, they can't replay it without the decryption key\n\n**3. Use challenge-response** (two-way communication)\n- Car sends: \"What's the password for Code #47?\"\n- Fob sends: \"The answer is XYZ\"\n- Car: \"Correct! Unlock.\"\n- This prevents replay because the challenge changes every time\n\n**4. Use smartphone-based access** (Tesla, BMW, etc.)\n- Uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or NFC\n- More secure than RF key fobs (but has its own vulnerabilities—see BLE lesson!)\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Key Takeaway\n\n**Software Defined Radio is like a universal remote that can:**\n- **Listen** to any wireless signal (garage doors, car key fobs, baby monitors, weather stations)\n- **Record** those signals (like recording audio)\n- **Replay** those signals (like pressing the button yourself)\n\n**Most devices use simple, unencrypted signals** that are vulnerable to replay attacks.\n\n**As a pentester, your job is to:**\n1. Find these vulnerable devices (RF reconnaissance)\n2. Capture their signals (with an SDR)\n3. Replay or manipulate the signals (with a transmitter)\n4. Report the risk to the client\n5. Recommend defenses (rolling codes, encryption)\n\nNext, we'll dive into the technical details of how SDR works! 🚀"}

OOK (On-Off Keying) - Simplest Modulation**\n\n**How it works:**\n- **Bit 1** = Transmitter ON (signal present)\n- **Bit 0** = Transmitter OFF (no signal)\n\n**Visual:**\n```\nBit stream:  1   1   0   0   1   0   1\n            ___     ___         ___     \nSignal:     |_|     |_|         |_|     \n            ON      ON          ON\n```\n\n**Real-world uses:**\n- **Old garage door openers** (pre-1993)\n- **Simple wireless doorbells**\n- **Cheap RF remotes** (lighting controls, toys)\n- **Weather station sensors**\n\n**Why hackers love OOK:**\n- ✅ **Extremely simple to decode** (just detect ON/OFF)\n- ✅ **Easy to replay** (record signal, retransmit exactly)\n- ✅ **No encryption** (raw bits transmitted)\n\n**Detection in GQRX:**\n- Waterfall shows **discrete bursts** (signal appears/disappears)\n- **Amplitude spikes** when button pressed\n\n---\n\n### **2. ASK (Amplitude Shift Keying) - OOK's Cousin**\n\n**How it works:**\n- **Bit 1** = High amplitude\n- **Bit 0** = Low amplitude (NOT off, just quieter)\n\n**Difference from OOK:**\n- OOK = ON/OFF (two states: 100% amplitude vs 0% amplitude)\n- ASK = HIGH/LOW (two states: 100% amplitude vs 30% amplitude)\n\n**Real-world uses:**\n- **RFID tags** (125 kHz, 13.56 MHz)\n- **Some car key fobs**\n- **Wireless sensors**\n\n**Why slightly better than OOK:**\n- ✅ Less susceptible to interference (always transmitting)\n- ✅ Easier for receiver to maintain sync\n\n**But still vulnerable:**\n- ❌ Easy to decode\n- ❌ No encryption\n- ❌ Replay attacks work\n\n---\n\n### **3. FSK (Frequency Shift Keying) - More Advanced**\n\n**How it works:**\n- **Bit 1** = Transmit at frequency F1 (e.g., 433.92 MHz)\n- **Bit 0** = Transmit at frequency F0 (e.g., 433.88 MHz)\n\n**Visual:**\n```\nBit stream:  1    0    1    1    0\n            \nFrequency:  F1   F0   F1   F1   F0\n            433.92 MHz and 433.88 MHz\n```\n\n**Real-world uses:**\n- **Modern car key fobs** (with rolling codes)\n- **Tire pressure monitoring systems (TPMS)**\n- **Wireless temperature sensors**\n- **Industrial IoT devices**\n\n**Why more secure than OOK:**\n- ✅ **More resistant to noise** (amplitude doesn't matter)\n- ✅ **Better for long-range transmission**\n- ✅ Often paired with encryption (but not always!)\n\n**But still vulnerable if:**\n- ❌ No encryption (raw bits)\n- ❌ Fixed codes (replay attacks)\n- ❌ Weak encryption (proprietary algorithms often broken)\n\n**Detection in GQRX:**\n- Waterfall shows **two distinct frequencies**\n- Signal \"hops\" between F0 and F1\n\n---\n\n### **4. GFSK (Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying) - FSK++**\n\n**How it works:**\n- Same as FSK, but transitions between frequencies are **smoother** (Gaussian filter)\n- Reduces bandwidth and interference\n\n**Real-world uses:**\n- **Bluetooth** (GFSK with 2.4 GHz)\n- **Zigbee** (IoT mesh networks)\n- **Some modern garage doors**\n\n**Advantages:**\n- ✅ More bandwidth-efficient than FSK\n- ✅ Less interference with adjacent channels\n\n**Still vulnerable to:**\n- ❌ Protocol-level attacks (if encryption is weak)\n- ❌ Replay attacks (if no rolling codes)\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 How to Identify Modulation Scheme in GQRX\n\n**Step 1: Capture signal in waterfall display**\n\n**OOK/ASK signals look like:**\n```\nWaterfall (frequency vs time):\n\n  ║▓▓▓║    ║▓▓║    ║▓▓▓▓║  ← Signal bursts\n  ║   ║    ║  ║    ║    ║\n  ╚═══╩════╩══╩════╩════╝\n   Time →\n\n- Discrete ON/OFF bursts\n- Single frequency (no hopping)\n- Clear gaps between transmissions\n```\n\n**FSK signals look like:**\n```\nWaterfall:\n\n  ║▓║▓║▓▓║▓║▓▓║▓║  ← Two frequency bands\n  ║▓║▓║▓▓║▓║▓▓║▓║\n  ╚═══════════════╝\n   Time →\n\n- Two distinct horizontal bands\n- Continuous transmission (no gaps)\n- \"Hoppy\" appearance between F0 and F1\n```\n\n**Step 2: Analyze with Inspectrum or URH**\n\n**For OOK:**\n- Clear ON/OFF pattern\n- Bit rate = 1 / (pulse width)\n- Example: 500 µs pulse width = 2,000 bps\n\n**For FSK:**\n- Measure frequency deviation (F1 - F0)\n- Measure symbol rate (how fast it switches)\n- Example: F1 = 433.92 MHz, F0 = 433.88 MHz, deviation = 40 kHz\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 ISM Bands: The \"Free\" Spectrum\n\n**ISM** = **I**ndustrial, **S**cientific, **M**edical bands\n\n**These frequencies are unlicensed** (anyone can use them without FCC license):\n\n**Key ISM bands:**\n\n| **Frequency** | **Region** | **Common Uses** |\n|---------------|------------|------------------|\n| **315 MHz** | North America | Garage doors, car key fobs, tire pressure sensors |\n| **433.92 MHz** | Europe, Asia | Garage doors, remotes, IoT sensors, drones |\n| **868 MHz** | Europe | LoRa IoT, smart meters, Z-Wave (EU) |\n| **915 MHz** | North America | LoRa IoT, RFID, smart meters, Z-Wave (US) |\n| **2.4 GHz** | Global | Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, baby monitors, microwave ovens |\n| **5.8 GHz** | Global | Wi-Fi (5 GHz), FPV drones, radar sensors |\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 Why Pentesters Focus on 315 MHz and 433 MHz\n\n**1. Massive number of vulnerable devices**\n- Millions of pre-1993 garage doors still in use (fixed codes)\n- Many car key fobs use 315 MHz (US) or 433 MHz (EU)\n- Industrial remotes (gates, barriers, cranes)\n- Wireless doorbells and alarm systems\n\n**2. Easy to attack**\n- OOK/ASK modulation (simple to decode)\n- Fixed codes (replay attacks)\n- No encryption on many devices\n\n**3. Physical impact**\n- Unlock garage doors → physical access to building\n- Clone car key fobs → vehicle theft\n- Trigger industrial equipment → safety hazards\n\n**4. Low detection risk**\n- Most organizations don't monitor RF spectrum\n- No logs (unlike network traffic)\n- Short-range attacks (harder to trace)\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Signal Characteristics to Document\n\nWhen you capture a signal, record these parameters:\n\n**1. Center frequency** (e.g., 315.000 MHz, 433.920 MHz)\n- Use GQRX waterfall to identify peak\n\n**2. Bandwidth** (how wide is the signal?)\n- OOK: ~10-50 kHz\n- FSK: ~20-100 kHz (depends on deviation)\n\n**3. Modulation type** (OOK, ASK, FSK, GFSK)\n- Visual inspection in waterfall\n- Demodulate and listen (AM for OOK/ASK, FM for FSK)\n\n**4. Symbol rate / Baud rate** (how fast are bits transmitted?)\n- Use Inspectrum cursor to measure symbol width\n- Common rates: 1,000 bps, 2,400 bps, 4,800 bps, 38,400 bps\n\n**5. Packet structure** (how long is each transmission?)\n- Count symbols/bits per burst\n- Example: 40-bit fixed code, 64-bit rolling code, 128-bit encrypted\n\n**6. Repetition** (does it send the same code multiple times?)\n- Many remotes send 3-5 identical packets\n- Improves reliability, but makes capture easier\n\n**7. Timing** (when does the signal appear?)\n- On-demand (button press) vs periodic (sensor reporting every 30 sec)\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Using GQRX for Signal Reconnaissance\n\n**Step 1: Connect RTL-SDR and launch GQRX**\n```bash\n# Plug in RTL-SDR\ngqrx\n# Or on Windows: Launch SDR#\n```\n\n**Step 2: Configure for 315 MHz scanning**\n- **Frequency**: 315,000,000 Hz (315 MHz)\n- **Mode**: AM (for OOK/ASK) or FM (for FSK)\n- **Filter width**: 50 kHz\n- **Gain**: Auto (or manual: RF gain ~30-40 dB)\n\n**Step 3: Monitor waterfall display**\n- Look for bursts of activity (signals appearing/disappearing)\n- Zoom in on active frequencies\n\n**Step 4: Trigger signal**\n- Have someone press garage door remote\n- Press car key fob\n- Ring wireless doorbell\n\n**Step 5: Record signal**\n- GQRX: Click red record button → saves to WAV or IQ file\n- Note: **Record as IQ data** (not audio) for best quality\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Key Takeaways: Modulation and Analysis\n\n✅ **OOK/ASK** = Simplest modulation (ON/OFF), used in garage doors, remotes\n\n✅ **FSK/GFSK** = Frequency shifting, used in car key fobs, IoT sensors\n\n✅ **ISM bands** (315 MHz, 433 MHz) = Unlicensed frequencies with massive vulnerable device population\n\n✅ **GQRX waterfall display** = Visual tool to identify signals\n\n✅ **Document signal parameters** (frequency, modulation, symbol rate, packet structure)\n\nNext: Hands-on labs with Universal Radio Hacker! 🚀"}

Check\n```\n\n**Step 2: Identify fields**\n\n**Common structures:**\n\n**1. Preamble** (8-16 bits)\n- Pattern: `11111111` or `10101010`\n- Purpose: Receiver gain control, frequency lock\n\n**2. Sync word** (8-16 bits)\n- Pattern: `10101010` or `01010101`\n- Purpose: Bit synchronization\n\n**3. Device ID** (24-32 bits)\n- Unique identifier for remote\n- Prevents cross-talk (your remote won't open neighbor's door)\n\n**4. Command** (4-8 bits)\n- Examples:\n  - `0001` = Open\n  - `0010` = Close\n  - `0011` = Stop\n  - `0100` = Light toggle\n\n**5. Counter** (for rolling codes)\n- Increments each transmission\n- Prevents replay attacks\n\n**6. Checksum/CRC** (8-16 bits)\n- Error detection\n- Common: XOR of all previous bits, CRC-8, CRC-16\n\n**Step 3: Test hypotheses**\n\n**Hypothesis**: \"Bits 16-47 are the fixed device ID\"\n\n**Test**:\n1. Capture signal from **different remote** (neighbor's, second remote)\n2. Compare bit patterns\n3. If bits 16-47 are different, hypothesis confirmed!\n\n**Hypothesis**: \"Last 8 bits are XOR checksum\"\n\n**Test**:\n```python\n# Extract bits\nbits = \"10110101100111001100101010111001\"\nchecksum_received = \"01010101\"\n\n# Calculate XOR of all data bits\nxor = 0\nfor byte in [bits[i:i+8] for i in range(0, len(bits), 8)]:\n    xor ^= int(byte, 2)\n\nprint(f\"Calculated: {bin(xor)[2:].zfill(8)}\")\nprint(f\"Received: {checksum_received}\")\n\n# If they match, checksum confirmed!\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Lab Exercise 5: Brute-Force Fixed-Code Systems\n\n**Scenario**: You can't capture the signal (neighbor is away), but you know the device uses a fixed 20-bit code.\n\n**Attack**: Transmit all 2^20 = 1,048,576 possible codes\n\n**⚠️ WARNING: This is NOISY and may trigger alarms! Only do this on your own devices in a controlled environment.**\n\n**URH Script** (simplified):\n```python\nimport urh\nfrom urh.signalprocessing.Signal import Signal\n\n# Configuration\nfrequency = 315000000  # 315 MHz\nmodulation = \"ASK\"\ncode_length = 20  # bits\npreamble = \"11111111\"  # 8 bits\nsync = \"10101010\"  # 8 bits\n\n# Generate all possible codes\nfor code in range(2**code_length):\n    # Convert to binary\n    code_bits = format(code, f'0{code_length}b')\n    \n    # Build full packet\n    packet = preamble + sync + code_bits\n    \n    # Transmit\n    # (URH transmission code here)\n    \n    # Small delay (10ms)\n    time.sleep(0.01)\n    \n    print(f\"Trying code {code}/{2**code_length}: {code_bits}\")\n```\n\n**Time estimate:**\n- 1,048,576 codes × 10ms = 10,485 seconds = **2.9 hours**\n- With optimizations (shorter delay, parallel): ~30-60 minutes\n\n**Real-world use case:**\n- Old garage doors (8-12 bit codes): **< 1 minute**\n- Modern rolling codes: **Brute-force not feasible** (64-bit space = 584 billion years at 10ms/code)\n\n---\n\n## 📋 Lab Deliverables\n\n**1.

Vulnerability Assessment**\n\n**Finding**: Fixed-Code Garage Door System Vulnerable to Replay Attacks\n\n**Severity**: CRITICAL\n\n**Description**: \nThe Chamberlain garage door opener (model XYZ, manufactured 1990) uses a fixed 32-bit code with OOK modulation at 315 MHz. The code does not change between transmissions, making it trivial to capture and replay.\n\n**Proof of Concept**:\n1. Captured signal using RTL-SDR and GQRX\n2. Analyzed with Universal Radio Hacker, identified fixed bit pattern\n3. Replayed using HackRF One—garage door opened successfully\n4. Attack requires <1 minute and $350 in hardware\n\n**Impact**:\n- Attacker can gain unauthorized physical access to garage/building\n- Attack range: 10-100 meters (with directional antenna)\n- No authentication, no logging\n\n**Recommendation**:\n1. Replace with modern rolling-code opener (Security+ 2.0, HomeLink)\n2. Add secondary authentication (PIN pad, smart lock)\n3. Install motion sensors and cameras as detection layer\n\n**4. Defense Recommendations**\n\n**Short-term** (if replacement not possible):\n- Unplug opener when away for extended periods\n- Install physical lock on garage door as backup\n- Add camera to monitor garage entry\n\n**Long-term**:\n- Upgrade to rolling-code system (KeeLoq, Security+ 2.0)\n- Consider Wi-Fi/smartphone-based garage door controller\n- Implement RF monitoring (detect replay attempts)\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Key Lab Takeaways\n\n✅ **GQRX is excellent for RF reconnaissance** (identify active signals)\n\n✅ **Universal Radio Hacker (URH) is the best tool for protocol analysis** (decode bits, reverse engineer)\n\n✅ **Fixed-code systems are trivially vulnerable** (capture once, replay forever)\n\n✅ **Rolling-code systems are more secure** but vulnerable to RollJam (jam + capture)\n\n✅ **ISM bands (315 MHz, 433 MHz) are full of vulnerable devices** (garage doors, remotes, sensors)\n\n✅ **Transmitting requires HackRF One** ($330) and **legal authorization**\n\nNext: Real-world case studies of RF attacks! 🚀"}

Security experts thought the problem was solved.\n\n**Samy Kamkar proved them wrong.**\n\n**The Problem with Rolling Codes**:\n```\nNormal operation:\nUser presses key fob (Code #1) → Car receives → Unlocks → Increments counter (expecting Code #2)\nUser presses again (Code #2) → Car receives → Unlocks → Increments counter (expecting Code #3)\n\nReplay attack (FAILS):\nAttacker captures Code #2 → User presses again (Code #3) → Car expects Code #3\nAttacker replays Code #2 → Car rejects (\"I already saw Code #2!\")\n```\n\n**But what if the attacker can prevent Code #1 from reaching the car?**\n\n**RollJam Attack**:\n```\nStep 1: Attacker positions RollJam device near target car (in parking lot)\nStep 2: RollJam JAMS the frequency (315 MHz) with noise\nStep 3: User presses \"unlock\" (Code #1)\nStep 4: Car DOESN'T unlock (signal jammed)\nStep 5: RollJam CAPTURES Code #1 (while jamming)\nStep 6: User presses \"unlock\" AGAIN (Code #2)\nStep 7: RollJam CAPTURES Code #2 and immediately REPLAYS Code #1\nStep 8: Car receives Code #1 → Unlocks! (User walks away, satisfied)\nStep 9: Later, attacker returns and REPLAYS Code #2 → Car unlocks!\n```\n\n**Why this works**:\n- The car never heard Code #1 (it was jammed)\n- When the attacker replays Code #1, the car thinks it's the \"next\" code\n- The car increments its counter to expect Code #2\n- The user already transmitted Code #2, but the attacker captured it\n- Now the attacker has a valid \"future code\" (Code #2) they can use anytime\n\n---\n\n### **RollJam Hardware**\n\n**Components** ($30-40 total):\n- **Arduino** (microcontroller): $15\n- **2x RF receiver modules** (315 MHz and 433 MHz): $5 each\n- **2x RF transmitter modules** (315 MHz and 433 MHz): $5 each\n- **Battery**: $5\n- **Case**: 3D printed\n\n**How it works**:\n1. **Receiver 1**: Listens for legitimate key fob signal\n2. **Transmitter 1**: Jams the frequency (transmits noise)\n3. **Receiver 2**: Captures the signal (while jamming)\n4. **Transmitter 2**: Replays the PREVIOUS code\n\n**Open-source**: Samy published the code and schematics (GitHub: samyk/rollam)\n\n---\n\n### **Demonstration at DEF CON 23 (2015)**\n\nSamy demonstrated RollJam live on stage:\n\n**Test 1: Garage door**\n- Used RollJam on modern Security+ 2.0 garage door opener\n- Captured 2 codes while jamming\n- Successfully opened garage door later with captured code\n- **Result**: VULNERABLE\n\n**Test 2: Car key fob**\n- Tested on 2013 Toyota Camry\n- Captured codes while victim tried to lock car\n- Replayed code to unlock car 10 minutes later\n- **Result**: VULNERABLE\n\n**Test 3: Multiple car brands**\n- Tested: Honda, Toyota, Nissan, Ford, Chevy, VW\n- **All vulnerable** to RollJam attack\n\n**Audience reaction**: Stunned silence, then applause. \n\nSamy had just proven that **rolling codes don't protect against a $30 device**.\n\n---\n\n### **Impact**\n\n**Real-world attacks (2016-present)**:\n\n**1. Car theft rings (UK, 2017)**\n- Thieves using RollJam clones stole 100+ high-end cars (Range Rover, BMW, Mercedes)\n- Parked outside homes, waited for owner to lock car\n- Captured codes, returned at night to steal cars\n- **Estimated losses**: £5 million+\n\n**2. Valet key theft (US, 2018)**\n- Valet parking attendants using RollJam to capture codes\n- Returned to parking garage at night to steal cars\n- 30+ luxury cars stolen before police investigation\n- **Outcome**: Valet company sued, shut down\n\n**3. Garage break-ins (suburbs, ongoing)**\n- Attackers target affluent neighborhoods\n- Walk down street with RollJam in backpack\n- Capture garage door codes when homeowners arrive home\n- Return at night to burglarize homes\n- **Detection difficulty**: No forced entry, no alarm triggers\n\n---\n\n### **Vendor Response**\n\n**Automotive industry**:\n\n**1. Firmware updates** (2016-2017)\n- Some manufacturers released updates to key fob firmware\n- Added \"jam detection\" (if multiple unlock attempts fail, require physical key)\n- **Effectiveness**: Limited—many older cars never updated\n\n**2. Challenge-response systems** (2018+)\n- Newer cars use **bidirectional authentication**:\n  - Car sends challenge: \"What's the response to nonce XYZ?\"\n  - Key fob must calculate correct response (cryptographic HMAC)\n  - Prevents replay (challenge changes each time)\n- **Examples**: Tesla Model 3, BMW i-series, Mercedes S-Class (2019+)\n\n**3. UWB (Ultra-Wideband) systems** (2020+)\n- Apple CarKey (iPhone)\n- Measures distance precisely (prevents relay attacks)\n- **Examples**: BMW, Genesis, Hyundai\n\n**Garage door industry**:\n\n**1. MyQ / Wi-Fi openers**\n- Shift to smartphone control (no RF key fobs)\n- Uses TLS encryption over Wi-Fi\n- **Trade-off**: Now vulnerable to Wi-Fi attacks instead of RF\n\n**2. Security+ 2.0 updates**\n- Chamberlain/LiftMaster rolled out firmware updates\n- Added time-limited codes (code expires after 5 minutes if not used)\n- **Effectiveness**: Reduces RollJam window but doesn't eliminate it\n\n---\n\n### **Lessons Learned**\n\n**For pentesters**:\n1. **\"Secure\" doesn't mean \"unbreakable\"** — Rolling codes were marketed as \"hack-proof\"\n2. **Side-channel attacks matter** — Jamming + capture = protocol bypass\n3. **Simple attacks are often the most effective** — $30 device > theoretical crypto analysis\n4. **Physical proximity = opportunity** — Parking lots are goldmines for RF attacks\n\n**For defenders**:\n1. **Rolling codes are necessary but insufficient** — Need additional layers (challenge-response, time limits)\n2. **Jam detection is critical** — If multiple unlock attempts fail, require physical key\n3. **Frequency hopping helps** — Makes jamming harder (but not impossible)\n4. **UWB/distance bounding** — Prevents relay attacks by measuring signal latency\n5. **Shift to smartphone-based systems** — BLE/NFC with challenge-response is stronger\n\n---\n\n## 🌍 Case Study 2: TPMS (Tire Pressure Monitoring) Attacks (2010-Present)\n\n**Attacker**: Security researchers (Rutgers University, Ishtiaq Rouf et al.)\n**Target**: Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS) in modern cars\n**Vulnerability**: Unencrypted sensor data, spoofing, tracking\n**Attack Vector**: SDR (RTL-SDR + GNURadio)\n\n---\n\n### **Background: What is TPMS?**\n\n**TPMS** = Tire Pressure Monitoring System\n\n**Purpose**: Alert driver when tire pressure is low (safety feature)\n\n**How it works**:\n1. Each tire has a **sensor** (battery-powered, inside the tire)\n2. Sensor measures **pressure** and **temperature**\n3. Sensor **broadcasts RF signal** every 30-60 seconds\n4. Car's **receiver** (inside dashboard) displays pressure on instrument cluster\n\n**Frequency**: \n- **US**: 315 MHz\n- **EU**: 433 MHz\n\n**Modulation**: FSK (Frequency Shift Keying)\n\n**Required by law**: US TREAD Act (2007) mandates TPMS on all new cars\n\n---\n\n### **The Attack**\n\n**Phase 1: Eavesdropping (Privacy violation)**\n\n**Research finding** (2010, Rutgers):\n- TPMS sensors broadcast **unique 32-bit ID** (like a MAC address)\n- ID is **not encrypted** and transmitted in clear text\n- ID **never changes** (tied to physical sensor hardware)\n\n**Attack**:\n```bash\n# Attacker parks near target car\n# Uses RTL-SDR to capture TPMS signals at 315 MHz\nrtl_sdr -f 315000000 -s 250000 - | tpms_decoder\n\n# Output:\nSensor ID: 0xA3F2E1D0 (Front Left)\n  Pressure: 32 PSI\n  Temperature: 68°F\n  Battery: 3.0V\n\nSensor ID: 0xB4A3F2E1 (Front Right)\n  Pressure: 32 PSI\n  Temperature: 69°F\n  Battery: 2.9V\n\n# Attacker logs IDs\n```\n\n**Privacy implications**:\n1. **Vehicle tracking**: TPMS IDs are unique → can track individual cars\n2. **Traffic analysis**: Deploy SDR receivers at intersections → track all passing cars\n3. **Surveillance**: Government/corporations could track vehicle movements without GPS\n\n**Real-world proof-of-concept** (2013, USENIX Security):\n- Researchers deployed RTL-SDRs at 3 intersections in a city\n- Tracked 10,000+ vehicles over 1 week\n- Matched TPMS IDs to license plates (camera correlation)\n- Built complete traffic patterns (where people live, work, shop)\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 2: Spoofing (False data injection)**\n\n**Attack goal**: Trick the car into displaying false tire pressure\n\n**Why this matters**:\n- Driver sees \"32 PSI\" on dashboard → thinks tires are fine\n- Actual tire pressure: **20 PSI** (dangerously low)\n- Driver continues driving → **tire blowout** at highway speeds → crash\n\n**Attack steps**:\n\n**Step 1: Capture legitimate TPMS signal**\n```bash\nrtl_sdr -f 315000000 -s 250000 tpms_capture.raw\n# Press tire valve to trigger immediate transmission\n# Parse captured data\n```\n\n**Step 2: Decode packet structure**\n```\nTPMS packet (64 bits):\n[Preamble: 8 bits] [ID: 32 bits] [Pressure: 8 bits] [Temp: 8 bits] [Flags: 4 bits] [CRC: 8 bits]\n\nExample:\n10101010 A3F2E1D0 0x20 0x44 0x0 0x3F\n         Front left 32 PSI 68°F OK  CRC\n```\n\n**Step 3: Craft malicious packet**\n```python\n# Change pressure from 32 PSI to 15 PSI\nmalicious_pressure = 0x0F  # 15 PSI\n\n# Rebuild packet\nmalicious_packet = preamble + sensor_id + malicious_pressure + temp + flags + calculate_crc()\n\n# Transmit using HackRF One\ntransmit_fsk(frequency=315000000, packet=malicious_packet, repeat=10)\n```\n\n**Step 4: Observe dashboard**\n\n**Result**: Dashboard displays \"15 PSI\" warning light! 🚨\n\n**Car thinks tire is flat** even though tire pressure is actually normal.\n\n---\n\n### **Phase 3: Denial of Service (Jamming)**\n\n**Attack**: Continuously transmit noise at 315 MHz\n\n**Result**: Car can't receive TPMS signals → Dashboard shows \"TPMS Malfunction\" warning\n\n**Why this matters**:\n- Driver sees warning → takes car to mechanic → mechanic finds nothing wrong\n- Driver ignores warning → Real tire pressure issue goes undetected\n- Driver disables TPMS warning (if possible) → Safety feature defeated\n\n**Jamming is trivial**:\n```bash\nhackrf_transfer -t /dev/zero -f 315000000 -s 2000000\n# Transmits noise at 315 MHz\n# Effective range: ~10 meters (more with amplifier)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Impact**\n\n**Real-world attacks**:\n\n**1. Vehicle tracking by law enforcement** (ongoing)\n- DEA, FBI use TPMS tracking for surveillance\n- Cheaper than GPS trackers (no warrant needed—TPMS broadcasts publicly)\n- **Legal gray area**: Courts haven't ruled if TPMS tracking violates 4th Amendment\n\n**2. Private investigators** (divorce, insurance fraud cases)\n- Track spouse's car via TPMS\n- Correlate location with suspicions\n- **Legal status**: Varies by state\n\n**3. Toll road evasion detection** (proposed, not deployed)\n- Some toll agencies considered TPMS tracking as alternative to RFID tags\n- **Abandoned due to privacy concerns**\n\n**4. Tire shops for service reminders** (marketing)\n- Some tire shops log TPMS IDs when customers visit\n- Send reminders: \"Your tire sensors need service!\"\n- **Legal**: Customer implied consent, but creepy\n\n---\n\n### **Vendor Response**\n\n**Automotive manufacturers** (2015+):\n\n**1. Encrypted TPMS** (rare)\n- Some luxury brands (BMW, Mercedes) added AES encryption\n- **Problem**: Increases cost ($10-20 per sensor), adds complexity\n- **Adoption**: <5% of vehicles\n\n**2. Rolling IDs** (proposed, not widely deployed)\n- Change sensor ID every transmission (like rolling codes)\n- **Problem**: Car's receiver needs to track all 4 sensor IDs\n- **Adoption**: Very rare\n\n**3. Indirect TPMS** (alternative approach)\n- No RF sensors—uses ABS wheel speed sensors\n- Detects low pressure by measuring wheel rotation speed (low tire = faster rotation)\n- **Pros**: No RF, no tracking, cheaper\n- **Cons**: Less accurate, doesn't detect slow leaks\n- **Adoption**: 30% of new cars (mostly economy models)\n\n**4. No response** (majority)\n- Most manufacturers ignored the research\n- \"TPMS is a safety feature, not a security feature\"\n- \"Attacks require specialized equipment\"\n- **Reality**: RTL-SDR costs $25, attacks are trivial\n\n---\n\n### **Lessons Learned**\n\n**For pentesters**:\n1. **Safety systems are often insecure** — TPMS, ADAS, airbags use unencrypted RF\n2. **Passive reconnaissance is powerful** — No active attack needed to track vehicles\n3. **Spoofing can cause physical harm** — False tire pressure → crashes\n4. **Privacy implications matter** — TPMS tracking = warrantless surveillance\n\n**For defenders**:\n1. **Encrypt all RF communications** — Even \"low-value\" sensor data\n2. **Use rolling IDs** — Static IDs enable tracking\n3. **Add message authentication** — HMAC to prevent spoofing\n4. **Consider wired alternatives** — Indirect TPMS avoids RF entirely\n5. **Regulatory action needed** — TREAD Act mandates TPMS but not security\n\n---\n\n## 🌍 Case Study 3: KeySweeper - Keylogger for Microsoft Wireless Keyboards (2015)\n\n**Attacker**: Samy Kamkar (again!)\n**Target**: Microsoft wireless keyboards (2.4 GHz, not Bluetooth)\n**Vulnerability**: Unencrypted keystrokes, no authentication\n**Device**: KeySweeper (Arduino + nRF24L01 RF module, $40)\n\n---\n\n### **Background**\n\nMicrosoft wireless keyboards (pre-2016) used proprietary 2.4 GHz protocol:\n- **Not Bluetooth** (custom protocol)\n- **Not Wi-Fi** (different modulation)\n- **Encrypted?** Microsoft claimed \"AES encryption\"\n\n**Reality**: Encryption was optional and **disabled by default** for \"performance\"\n\n---\n\n### **The Attack**\n\n**KeySweeper** = Stealthy wireless keylogger disguised as USB wall charger\n\n**How it works**:\n1. **Hidden inside USB wall charger** (looks like normal phone charger)\n2. **nRF24L01 module** (2.4 GHz receiver, $2)\n3. **Arduino** (microcontroller, $15)\n4. **GSM module** (sends captured keystrokes via SMS, optional, $20)\n5. **Battery** (works even when unplugged from wall, for stealth)\n\n**Attack flow**:\n```\n1. Attacker plugs KeySweeper into wall outlet in target office\n2. KeySweeper listens on 2.4 GHz for Microsoft keyboard packets\n3. When target types, KeySweeper captures keystrokes\n4. KeySweeper logs keystrokes to microSD card\n5. (Optional) KeySweeper sends keystrokes via SMS to attacker's phone\n6. Attacker retrieves KeySweeper later (or just leaves it for months)\n```\n\n**Captured data**:\n- **All keystrokes** (passwords, emails, credit cards, private messages)\n- **Timestamps** (when each keystroke typed)\n- **Keyboard ID** (can distinguish multiple keyboards in same room)\n\n---\n\n### **Live Demonstration (2015)**\n\nSamy demonstrated KeySweeper on his blog:\n\n**Test setup**:\n- Plugged KeySweeper into wall outlet 10 feet from victim keyboard\n- Victim typed: \"My password is: SuperSecretPass123!\"\n- KeySweeper captured: `M y   p a s s w o r d   i s :   S u p e r S e c r e t P a s s 1 2 3 !`\n\n**SMS alert**:\n```\nFrom: KeySweeper_01\nTimestamp: 2015-03-15 14:23:45\nKeyboard: 0xA3F2\nData: \"My password is: SuperSecretPass123!\"\n```\n\n**Stealth features**:\n- **Looks identical to normal USB charger** (no visible LEDs, antennas)\n- **Actually charges phones** (fully functional charger)\n- **Battery backup** (continues logging when unplugged)\n- **Remote wipe** (SMS command to erase logs if discovered)\n\n---\n\n### **Impact**\n\n**Vulnerable devices** (2015):\n- Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 800\n- Microsoft Wireless Desktop 2000\n- Microsoft Wireless Desktop 3000\n- Microsoft All-In-One Media Keyboard\n- And 10+ other models\n\n**Estimated affected users**: 100+ million keyboards worldwide\n\n**Real-world scenarios**:\n\n**1.

Conceptual Mastery Check**\n\n**Question**: Explain to a non-technical friend: \"What is Software Defined Radio and why should they care?\"\n\n**Your explanation**:\n```\n\n\n\n```\n\n**Key points to include**:\n- SDR = one device, many frequencies (unlike traditional radios)\n- Invisible signals control physical things (garage doors, cars)\n- Most are unencrypted and vulnerable to replay attacks\n- $25 device can capture signals from 100+ meters away\n\n---\n\n### **2. Practical Application**\n\n**Scenario**: You're conducting a pentest for a corporate campus. The client mentions they recently upgraded all door locks to \"secure wireless access control\" (RF-based badges at 125 kHz).\n\n**What tests would you perform? (List 5)**\n\n**Your test plan**:\n```\n1.\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\n4.\n\n5.\n```\n\n**Suggested tests**:\n1. **Frequency analysis**: Confirm 125 kHz frequency (low-frequency RFID)\n2. **Signal capture**: Record badge swipe with RTL-SDR (need HF converter for <24 MHz)\n3. **Protocol analysis**: Decode badge data (EM4100, HID Prox, etc.)\n4. **Replay attack**: Test if captured badge signal opens door\n5. **Cloning test**: Write captured data to blank RFID tag (T5577)\n6. **Range extension**: Test maximum capture distance (directional antenna)\n7. **Badge enumeration**: Scan for active badges in parking lot (privacy test)\n\n---\n\n### **3.
