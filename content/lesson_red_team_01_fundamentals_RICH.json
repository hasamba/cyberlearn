Red teaming tests if your security team can DETECT and RESPOND to sophisticated attacks.\n\n## Real-World Analogy\n\n**Penetration Test** = Fire inspector checking if smoke alarms work by testing each one\n\n**Red Team** = Starting a small controlled fire to see if:\n- Smoke alarms actually trigger\n- People evacuate properly\n- Fire department responds quickly\n- Emergency procedures work under stress\n\nRed teams test the ENTIRE security program, not just individual components."

        "text": "**Rules of Engagement (ROE)** are the legal contract defining what red teamers are authorized to do. Without ROE, hacking is illegal - even with good intentions.\n\n## What ROE Must Include\n\n### 1. Scope\n**What's IN scope** (you CAN attack):\n- Specific IP ranges (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)\n- Specific domains (e.g., company.com, app.company.com)\n- Specific physical locations (e.g., Building A, not Building B)\n- Specific techniques allowed (e.g., phishing, password spraying)\n\n**What's OUT of scope** (you CANNOT touch):\n- Production databases with customer data\n- Life-safety systems (medical devices, industrial controls)\n- Partner/vendor systems\n- Personal devices\n\n### 2. Timeline\n- Start date/time\n- End date/time\n- Allowed hours (24/7 or business hours only?)\n\n### 3. Communication Plan\n- Emergency contact (if something breaks)\n- Daily check-ins (optional)\n- How to signal if you need to stop\n\n### 4. Authorized Techniques\n**Allowed**:\n- Social engineering\n- Password attacks\n- Network exploitation\n- Physical intrusion\n\n**Prohibited**:\n- DoS/DDoS attacks (disrupting services)\n- Data destruction\n- Data exfiltration beyond proof-of-concept\n\n### 5. Get-Out-of-Jail-Free Letter\nSigned document from company leadership authorizing the engagement. Carry this at ALL times during physical intrusions.\n\n**Real Story**: Red teamer was arrested during a physical security test at a bank. He was in handcuffs until the bank's CISO arrived with the authorization letter. Police verified it and released him. Without that letter, he'd have been charged with trespassing.\n\n## Why ROE Matters\n\n**Without ROE**:\n- You're committing crimes (Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, Computer Misuse Act)\n- Company can deny they authorized you\n- You have no legal protection\n- Criminal charges, lawsuits, career destruction\n\n**With ROE**:\n- Legal authorization to attack (within defined boundaries)\n- Company can't claim unauthorized access\n- Protection if law enforcement gets involved\n- Professional relationship\n\n## The Golden Rule\n\n**NEVER START AN ENGAGEMENT WITHOUT SIGNED, WRITTEN ROE**\n\nVerbal authorization isn't enough. \"The CEO said it was okay\" won't hold up in court. Get it in writing, signed by someone with authority, before touching anything."

      "content": {
        "text": "Red teams follow a structured attack methodology based on how real threat actors operate. The most common model is the **Cyber Kill Chain** (developed by Lockheed Martin).\n\n## The 7 Phases of the Cyber Kill Chain\n\n### Phase 1: Reconnaissance\n**Goal**: Gather information about the target\n\n**Activities**:\n- OSINT (Open Source Intelligence): Google, LinkedIn, social media\n- Network scanning: Identify live hosts, open ports\n- Email harvesting: Find valid email addresses\n- Technology fingerprinting: What software versions?\n\n**Example**: Attacker discovers on LinkedIn that target company uses Cisco VPNs and Microsoft Exchange. They search for known vulnerabilities in those specific versions.\n\n### Phase 2: Weaponization\n**Goal**: Create the attack tool/payload\n\n**Activities**:\n- Develop exploits for discovered vulnerabilities\n- Create malicious documents (weaponized PDFs, Office docs)\n- Build phishing emails\n- Customize malware to evade detection\n\n**Example**: Create a malicious Excel spreadsheet with macros that download and execute a backdoor.\n\n### Phase 3: Delivery\n**Goal**: Transmit the weapon to the target\n\n**Methods**:\n- Phishing emails with malicious attachments\n- Malicious links (watering hole attacks)\n- USB drops in parking lot\n- Exploit public-facing applications (web server vulnerabilities)\n\n**Example**: Send phishing email to HR department with fake resume in weaponized PDF.\n\n### Phase 4: Exploitation\n**Goal**: Trigger the vulnerability\n\n**Activities**:\n- User opens malicious document â†’ macros execute\n- User clicks malicious link â†’ browser exploit triggers\n- Exploit code runs and gains initial access\n\n**Example**: HR opens the resume PDF, which exploits Adobe Reader vulnerability and executes attacker's code.\n\n### Phase 5: Installation\n**Goal**: Establish persistence (stay in the network even after reboots)\n\n**Activities**:\n- Install backdoor/remote access tool (RAT)\n- Create scheduled tasks or service\n- Modify registry keys\n- Add startup scripts\n\n**Example**: Malware installs persistence via Windows Registry Run key and connects to attacker's command-and-control server.\n\n### Phase 6: Command and Control (C2)\n**Goal**: Establish communication channel with compromised system\n\n**Activities**:\n- Victim system 'beacons' to attacker's server\n- Attacker sends commands remotely\n- Malware sends stolen data back\n- Often uses encrypted channels (HTTPS) to blend with normal traffic\n\n**Example**: Backdoor connects to attacker's server every 30 minutes, awaiting commands while looking like normal web traffic.\n\n### Phase 7: Actions on Objectives\n**Goal**: Achieve the attack's ultimate purpose\n\n**Activities**:\n- Data exfiltration (steal sensitive files)\n- Lateral movement (spread to other systems)\n- Privilege escalation (gain admin rights)\n- Deploy ransomware\n- Sabotage systems\n- Establish long-term access\n\n**Example**: Attacker moves from HR workstation to file server, steals customer database, and exfiltrates 10GB of data via encrypted channel.\n\n## Defensive Perspective\n\n**Breaking the Kill Chain**: Defenders only need to stop ONE phase to prevent the attack. The earlier you stop it, the better.\n\n- Stop at **Reconnaissance**: Limit information disclosure (security through obscurity isn't enough, but it helps)\n- Stop at **Delivery**: Email filtering, web proxies, USB device controls\n- Stop at **Exploitation**: Patching, EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)\n- Stop at **Installation**: Anti-malware, application whitelisting\n- Stop at **C2**: Network monitoring, firewall rules, DNS filtering\n- Stop at **Actions**: Data Loss Prevention (DLP), network segmentation\n\nRed teams test which phases the blue team can detect and stop."

      "content": {
        "text": "Red teaming is one of the few professions where you're PAID to break into systems. This power requires strict ethical boundaries.\n\n## The Hacker's Code of Ethics\n\n### 1. Authorization is EVERYTHING\n- Only attack systems you're authorized to attack\n- Never exceed your scope\n- If you find something out of scope, report it - don't exploit it\n\n### 2. Do No Harm\n- Don't destroy data (beyond proof-of-concept)\n- Don't disrupt business operations\n- Don't access personal/sensitive data unnecessarily\n- If you accidentally break something, report immediately\n\n### 3. Confidentiality\n- Don't disclose findings to unauthorized people\n- Don't brag about breaches on social media\n- Client data stays with the client\n- NDAs are sacred\n\n### 4. Professional Boundaries\n- Don't use client access for personal gain\n- Don't reuse techniques from one client against another without permission\n- Don't steal tools, credentials, or data\n\n### 5. Disclosure\n- Report all findings to the client\n- Don't hide embarrassing discoveries\n- Provide remediation guidance, not just criticism\n- Give clients time to fix issues before public disclosure\n\n## Legal Frameworks\n\n### United States: Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)\n- Unauthorized access to computers = Federal crime\n- Penalties: Fines up to $250,000, prison up to 10 years\n- **Defense**: Signed authorization from system owner\n\n### United Kingdom: Computer Misuse Act 1990\n- Similar to CFAA\n- Unauthorized access = Up to 2 years in prison\n- Unauthorized access with intent to commit further crimes = Up to 5 years\n\n### European Union: General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\n- Accessing personal data without authorization = Massive fines\n- Even with ROE, must minimize access to personal data\n\n## The Gray Areas\n\n### Scenario 1: You discover child abuse material during a red team engagement\n**Answer**: IMMEDIATELY stop, preserve evidence, contact law enforcement, notify client. Legal obligations override ROE.\n\n### Scenario 2: You find evidence of insider fraud\n**Answer**: Report to client contact per ROE. Don't investigate further without explicit authorization.\n\n### Scenario 3: You compromise a system out of scope\n**Answer**: Immediately exit, document what happened, report to client, don't exploit further.\n\n## Real-World Consequences\n\n**Case 1**: Security researcher tested airport Wi-Fi without authorization (thought it was legal research). Arrested, charged with CFAA violations, faced federal charges. Eventually case dismissed, but spent $100,000+ on legal fees and had passport seized for months.\n\n**Case 2**: Pentester exceeded scope by accessing HR database with employee salaries (was told to test web app only). Client pressed charges, pentester lost certifications, company lost insurance, pentester served 6 months in jail.\n\n**Case 3**: Red teamer properly authorized, but forgot to carry ROE letter during physical intrusion. Security called police. Red teamer spent 8 hours in custody until client confirmed authorization. Legal, but traumatic.\n\n## The Professional Mindset\n\nYou're not a hacker. You're a **security consultant** using offensive techniques to improve defense.\n\n- **Hackers** break in for personal gain or ego\n- **Red teamers** simulate hackers to help organizations improve\n\nAlways remember: Your goal is to make the world MORE secure, not less."
