        "text": "Git can feel overwhelming at first. New commands, strange terminology (staging? HEAD? origin?), mysterious errors. Many beginners ask: 'Why do I need this? Can't I just save files?'\n\nHere's the truth that changes everything: Git isn't just version control. It's your professional safety net, your collaboration enabler, and your career portfolio all in one.\n\n## The Reality for Security Professionals\n\nIn cybersecurity, you'll work with:\n- Detection rules that need constant tuning\n- Scripts that evolve as threats change\n- Incident response playbooks refined after each breach\n- Malware samples that need careful tracking\n- Research that requires reproducibility\n- Team projects where multiple people contribute\n\nWithout Git:\n- Lost work when experiments fail\n- No idea what changed between versions\n- Difficult collaboration (emailing files back and forth)\n- No audit trail (who changed what, when, why?)\n- Can't contribute to open-source security tools\n- Limited career visibility (no public portfolio)\n\nWith Git:\n- Safe experimentation (always can revert)\n- Complete history (every change documented)\n- Seamless collaboration (pull requests, code review)\n- Full audit trail (compliance-friendly)\n- Active community participation\n- GitHub profile as your resume\n\n## Building Your Confidence\n\nYou don't need to master Git to use it effectively. Start with this:\n\n**Week 1**: Create repos, make commits, push to GitHub (3 commands)\n**Week 2**: Add branching for experiments (2 more commands)\n**Week 3**: Collaborate with pull requests (GitHub web interface)\n**Week 4**: Add security best practices (.gitignore, signing)\n\nThat's it. The rest comes naturally as you use it.\n\n## The Career Impact\n\nYour GitHub profile is your security portfolio. Hiring managers look at:\n- Active repositories (you build things)\n- Contributions to security projects (community engagement)\n- Commit history (consistency, quality)\n- Documentation (communication skills)\n\nI've seen candidates get interviews purely based on their GitHub activity. Your commits tell your story.\n\n## Overcoming the Learning Curve\n\n**First time using Git**: Confusing and frustrating\n**After 10 commits**: You understand the basic flow\n**After 1 month**: Git feels natural\n**After 3 months**: You can't imagine working without it\n\nEvery expert Git user started exactly where you are. The difference? They pushed through the initial confusion.\n\n## The Mindset Shift\n\nDon't think: 'I need to learn Git'\nThink: 'I'm building my professional safety net and portfolio'\n\nEvery commit is practice. Every repository is progress. Every contribution is career development.\n\nThis lesson gives you the essential skills. The mastery comes from using Git daily.\n\nLet's start your Git journey."

      "content": {
        "text": "Welcome to Git and GitHub! Whether you're tracking malware samples, managing security scripts, collaborating on incident response playbooks, or contributing to open-source security tools, Git is the universal language of version control in cybersecurity.\n\nIn this lesson, you'll learn why Git has become indispensable for security professionals and how to use it effectively.\n\n## What is Git?\n\nGit is a distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. Unlike centralized systems, every Git repository contains the complete history of the project, making it resilient, fast, and perfect for both solo and team work.\n\n## Why Security Professionals Need Git\n\n**1. Script and Tool Management**\n\nSecurity professionals write countless scripts - from reconnaissance tools to automation frameworks. Git tracks every change, allowing you to:\n- Revert to working versions when experiments fail\n- Document what each script version does\n- Share tools with teammates while maintaining attribution\n- Collaborate on security automation\n\n**2. Incident Response Documentation**\n\nDuring incidents, you need to track:\n- YARA rules as threats evolve\n- Sigma detection rules\n- IOC lists and threat intelligence\n- Incident timelines and findings\n- Remediation scripts\n\nGit provides the audit trail you need.\n\n**3. Security Research**\n\nWhen analyzing malware or researching vulnerabilities:\n- Track your analysis notes and findings\n- Version your proof-of-concept code\n- Collaborate with other researchers\n- Maintain reproducible research\n\n**4. Open Source Security**\n\nThe security community thrives on GitHub:\n- MITRE ATT&CK framework\n- Metasploit Framework\n- Burp Suite extensions\n- Detection rules (Sigma, YARA)\n- CTF write-ups and learning resources\n\n**5. Career Development**\n\nYour GitHub profile is your security portfolio:\n- Showcase projects to employers\n- Contribute to security tools\n- Build reputation in the community\n- Document your learning journey\n\n## Git vs GitHub: Understanding the Difference\n\n**Git** = The tool (version control system)\n- Runs on your computer\n- Tracks changes locally\n- Works offline\n- Free and open source\n\n**GitHub** = The platform (hosting service)\n- Cloud storage for Git repositories\n- Collaboration features (pull requests, issues, wikis)\n- Social coding (follow, star, fork)\n- CI/CD integration\n- Free for public and private repos\n\n**Alternatives to GitHub:**\n- GitLab (self-hosted option, popular in enterprises)\n- Bitbucket (integrates with Atlassian tools)\n- Gitea (lightweight self-hosted)\n\nBut GitHub dominates the security community, so we'll focus there.\n\n## The Git Mental Model\n\nThink of Git as taking snapshots of your project over time:\n\n```\nSnapshot 1 → Snapshot 2 → Snapshot 3 → Snapshot 4\n   (Initial)   (Added     (Fixed bug)  (New feature)\n              feature)\n```\n\nEach snapshot is called a **commit**. You can:\n- Jump to any snapshot\n- Create alternate timelines (branches)\n- Merge timelines together\n- Compare snapshots\n\nThis is incredibly powerful for security work where you need to experiment safely.\n\n## The Three States of Git\n\nFiles in your Git repository exist in three states:\n\n1. **Modified** - You changed the file but haven't committed\n2. **Staged** - You marked the file to go into the next commit\n3. **Committed** - The file is safely stored in the Git database\n\nThis translates to three areas:\n\n```\nWorking Directory  →  Staging Area  →  Repository\n   (Modified)         (Staged)        (Committed)\n      ↓                   ↓                ↓\n   edit files         git add          git commit\n```\n\n## The Basic Git Workflow\n\n**Step 1: Create or modify files**\n```bash\necho '#!/bin/bash' > port-scanner.sh\necho 'nmap -sV $1' >> port-scanner.sh\nchmod +x port-scanner.sh\n```\n\n**Step 2: Check status**\n```bash\ngit status\n# Output:\n# On branch main\n# Untracked files:\n#   port-scanner.sh\n```\n\n**Step 3: Stage files (prepare for commit)**\n```bash\n# Stage specific file\ngit add port-scanner.sh\n\n# Or stage all changes\ngit add .\n\n# Or stage by pattern\ngit add *.sh\n```\n\n**Step 4: Check status again**\n```bash\ngit status\n# Output:\n# Changes to be committed:\n#   new file: port-scanner.sh\n```\n\n**Step 5: Commit (save snapshot)**\n```bash\ngit commit -m \"Add basic port scanner script\"\n# Output:\n# [main abc1234] Add basic port scanner script\n#  1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)\n```\n\n## Commit Message Best Practices\n\nGood commit messages are crucial for security work:\n\n**Good commit messages:**\n- \"Add Kerberoasting detection rule for Splunk\"\n- \"Fix false positive in ransomware YARA rule\"\n- \"Update incident response playbook with new TTPs\"\n- \"Refactor credential dumping script for stealth\"\n\n**Bad commit messages:**\n- \"update\"\n- \"fix stuff\"\n- \"asdfasdf\"\n- \"final version\" (spoiler: it's never final)\n\n**Format:**\n```\nSubject line (50 chars or less)\n\nDetailed explanation if needed. Explain WHAT changed\nand WHY, not HOW (the code shows how).\n\n- Use bullet points for multiple changes\n- Reference issue numbers: Fixes #123\n- Keep lines under 72 characters\n```"

      "content": {
        "text": "Let's get Git installed and configured properly. This is crucial because your Git configuration affects commit attribution and security.\n\n## Installation\n\n**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**\n```bash\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install git\n```\n\n**Linux (RHEL/CentOS):**\n```bash\nsudo yum install git\n```\n\n**macOS:**\n```bash\n# Using Homebrew\nbrew install git\n\n# Or install Xcode Command Line Tools\nxcode-select --install\n```\n\n**Windows:**\n1. Download from https://git-scm.com/download/win\n2. Run installer (keep defaults)\n3. Use Git Bash for commands\n\n## Verify Installation\n\n```bash\ngit --version\n# Should output: git version 2.x.x\n```\n\n## Essential Configuration\n\nConfigure your identity (this appears in every commit):\n\n```bash\n# Set your name\ngit config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\n\n# Set your email (use your GitHub email)\ngit config --global user.email \"your.email@example.com\"\n\n# Set default branch name to 'main' (modern standard)\ngit config --global init.defaultBranch main\n\n# Set default editor (choose one)\ngit config --global core.editor \"vim\"      # Linux/Mac\ngit config --global core.editor \"nano\"     # Beginner-friendly\ngit config --global core.editor \"code --wait\"  # VS Code\n\n# Enable colored output\ngit config --global color.ui auto\n```\n\n## View Your Configuration\n\n```bash\n# View all settings\ngit config --list\n\n# View specific setting\ngit config user.name\ngit config user.email\n```\n\n## Configuration Levels\n\nGit has three configuration levels:\n\n1. **--system** (all users): `/etc/gitconfig`\n2. **--global** (your user): `~/.gitconfig` or `~/.config/git/config`\n3. **--local** (specific repo): `.git/config`\n\nLocal overrides global, global overrides system.\n\n## Security Best Practice: Use Different Emails\n\nFor privacy, use GitHub's noreply email:\n\n```bash\n# Find it at: GitHub Settings → Emails → Keep my email private\ngit config --global user.email \"username@users.noreply.github.com\"\n```",

      "title": "Git Basics: Your First Repository",
      "content": {
        "text": "Let's create your first Git repository and learn the fundamental workflow.\n\n## Creating a Repository\n\nThere are two ways to start:\n\n**Option 1: Create a new repository**\n```bash\n# Create project directory\nmkdir security-scripts\ncd security-scripts\n\n# Initialize Git repository\ngit init\n# Output: Initialized empty Git repository in /path/to/security-scripts/.git/\n```\n\n**Option 2: Clone an existing repository**\n```bash\n# Clone from GitHub\ngit clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git\ncd repo-name\n```\n\n## Hands-On: Creating Your First Security Tool Repository\n\nCreate a repository for a simple security tool collection:\n\n```bash\n# Step 1: Create and initialize repository\nmkdir my-security-toolbox\ncd my-security-toolbox\ngit init\n\n# Step 2: Create README\ncat > README.md << 'EOF'\n# My Security Toolbox\n\nA collection of security scripts and tools for penetration testing and incident response.\n\n## Tools\n\n- port-scanner.sh - Basic port scanning wrapper\n- hash-identifier.sh - Identify hash types\n- log-analyzer.sh - Parse and analyze logs\n\n## Usage\n\nEach tool includes usage instructions in comments.\n\n## License\n\nMIT License - Use freely, attribute appropriately.\nEOF\n\n# Step 3: Create .gitignore (CRITICAL for security!)\ncat > .gitignore << 'EOF'\n# Credentials and sensitive data\n*.key\n*.pem\npasswords.txt\nsecrets/\n\n# Log files\n*.log\nlogs/\n\n# Temporary files\n*.tmp\n*.swp\n*~\n\n# OS files\n.DS_Store\nThumbs.db\n\n# IDE files\n.vscode/\n.idea/\nEOF\n\n# Step 4: Create first tool\ncat > port-scanner.sh << 'EOF'\n#!/bin/bash\n# Simple port scanner using nmap\n# Usage: ./port-scanner.sh <target-ip>\n\nif [ -z \"$1\" ]; then\n    echo \"Usage: $0 <target-ip>\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\necho \"[*] Scanning $1...\"\nnmap -sV -T4 $1\nEOF\n\nchmod +x port-scanner.sh\n\n# Step 5: Stage all files\ngit add .\n\n# Step 6: Check what's staged\ngit status\n\n# Step 7: Make first commit\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit: Add README, .gitignore, and port scanner\"\n\n# Step 8: View your commit\ngit log\n```\n\n## Understanding .gitignore\n\nThe `.gitignore` file is CRITICAL for security:\n\n**Never commit:**\n- Private keys (`.key`, `.pem`)\n- Passwords or credentials\n- API tokens\n- Session cookies\n- Database dumps with real data\n- Compiled malware samples\n\n**Pattern matching:**\n```\n# Ignore specific file\npasswords.txt\n\n# Ignore all files with extension\n*.key\n\n# Ignore directory\nsecrets/\n\n# Ignore files in any directory\n**/credentials.txt\n\n# Don't ignore (override)\n!important.key\n```\n\n## Adding More Tools\n\n```bash\n# Create second tool\ncat > hash-identifier.sh << 'EOF'\n#!/bin/bash\n# Identify hash type\n# Usage: ./hash-identifier.sh <hash>\n\nlength=${#1}\n\ncase $length in\n    32) echo \"Possibly MD5\" ;;\n    40) echo \"Possibly SHA-1\" ;;\n    64) echo \"Possibly SHA-256\" ;;\n    128) echo \"Possibly SHA-512\" ;;\n    *) echo \"Unknown hash type\" ;;\nesac\nEOF\n\nchmod +x hash-identifier.sh\n\n# Quick workflow (stage + commit)\ngit add hash-identifier.sh\ngit commit -m \"Add hash identifier tool\"\n```\n\n## Viewing History\n\n```bash\n# View commit history\ngit log\n\n# One line per commit (better for quick overview)\ngit log --oneline\n\n# View last 5 commits\ngit log -5\n\n# View commits with file changes\ngit log --stat\n\n# View commits with actual changes\ngit log -p\n\n# Search commits\ngit log --grep=\"malware\"\n\n# View commits by author\ngit log --author=\"YourName\"\n```"

      "title": "Branching: Experimenting Safely",
      "content": {
        "text": "Branching is Git's killer feature. It lets you experiment without breaking your working code - perfect for security research where you need to test multiple approaches.\n\n## What is a Branch?\n\nA branch is an independent line of development. Think of it as a parallel universe where you can make changes without affecting the main timeline.\n\n```\nmain:     A---B---C---D\n               \\\n feature:        E---F\n```\n\n## Why Branch?\n\n**In Security Work:**\n- Test new detection rules without breaking production\n- Experiment with exploit modifications\n- Develop new features for your tools\n- Work on multiple investigations simultaneously\n- Collaborate without conflicts\n\n## Basic Branch Commands\n\n```bash\n# List all branches (* = current)\ngit branch\n\n# Create new branch\ngit branch feature-new-scanner\n\n# Switch to branch\ngit checkout feature-new-scanner\n# Or use newer command\ngit switch feature-new-scanner\n\n# Create and switch in one command\ngit checkout -b feature-new-scanner\n# Or\ngit switch -c feature-new-scanner\n\n# View all branches (including remote)\ngit branch -a\n\n# Delete branch\ngit branch -d feature-name\n\n# Force delete (unmerged changes)\ngit branch -D feature-name\n```\n\n## Branching Workflow Example\n\n**Scenario:** You want to add a vulnerability scanner but don't want to break your working port scanner.\n\n```bash\n# Start on main branch\ngit checkout main\n\n# Create feature branch\ngit checkout -b feature-vuln-scanner\n\n# Make your changes\ncat > vuln-scanner.sh << 'EOF'\n#!/bin/bash\n# Vulnerability scanner using nmap NSE scripts\nnmap --script vuln $1\nEOF\n\nchmod +x vuln-scanner.sh\n\n# Commit on feature branch\ngit add vuln-scanner.sh\ngit commit -m \"Add vulnerability scanner using NSE\"\n\n# Switch back to main (vuln-scanner.sh disappears!)\ngit checkout main\nls  # No vuln-scanner.sh here\n\n# Switch back to feature (it's back!)\ngit checkout feature-vuln-scanner\nls  # vuln-scanner.sh is here\n```\n\n## Merging Branches\n\nOnce your feature works, merge it back to main:\n\n```bash\n# Switch to main\ngit checkout main\n\n# Merge feature branch\ngit merge feature-vuln-scanner\n\n# Delete feature branch (optional)\ngit branch -d feature-vuln-scanner\n```\n\n## Common Branching Strategies\n\n**1. Feature Branch Workflow (Recommended for small teams)**\n```\nmain (stable)\n  |\n  ├─ feature-1 (new detection rule)\n  ├─ feature-2 (fix false positive)\n  └─ feature-3 (update documentation)\n```\n\n**2. Gitflow (Complex projects)**\n```\nmain (production)\n  └─ develop (integration)\n       ├─ feature branches\n       ├─ release branches\n       └─ hotfix branches\n```\n\n**3. Trunk-Based (Simple projects)**\n```\nmain (everything happens here)\n  └─ short-lived feature branches\n```\n\n## Branch Naming Conventions\n\n**Good names:**\n- `feature/yara-rule-emotet`\n- `fix/false-positive-mimikatz`\n- `doc/update-readme`\n- `experiment/new-evasion-technique`\n\n**Bad names:**\n- `test`\n- `mybranch`\n- `asdf`\n- `final` (again, never final)\n\n## Viewing Branch Differences\n\n```bash\n# Compare branches\ngit diff main..feature-vuln-scanner\n\n# List commits in feature not in main\ngit log main..feature-vuln-scanner\n\n# Show branches merged into main\ngit branch --merged main\n\n# Show branches not yet merged\ngit branch --no-merged main\n```"

Never Commit Secrets\n\n**What NOT to commit:**\n- API keys\n- Passwords\n- Private keys (SSH, TLS, GPG)\n- Database credentials\n- Session tokens\n- AWS access keys\n- OAuth tokens\n\n**Prevention:**\n\n```bash\n# Use .gitignore\ncat >> .gitignore << EOF\n# Secrets\n*.key\n*.pem\n.env\nsecrets.yml\nconfig/credentials.yml\nEOF\n\n# Check what you're committing\ngit diff --staged\n\n# Use git-secrets (AWS tool)\ngit clone https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets.git\ncd git-secrets\nsudo make install\n\n# Install in repo\ncd your-repo\ngit secrets --install\ngit secrets --register-aws\n```\n\n**If you commit a secret by accident:**\n\n```bash\n# DANGER: Rewrites history\ngit filter-branch --force --index-filter \\\n  'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch secrets.txt' \\\n  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all\n\n# Or use BFG Repo-Cleaner (easier)\n# bfg --delete-files secrets.txt\n```\n\n**Important:** Rewriting history doesn't help if already pushed! Anyone who cloned the repo has the secret. You must:\n1. Revoke/rotate the compromised credential\n2. Clean the history\n3. Force push (warning: affects collaborators)\n\n## 2. Sign Your Commits\n\nCommit signing proves you wrote the code:\n\n```bash\n# Generate GPG key\ngpg --full-generate-key\n# Choose: (1) RSA and RSA\n# Key size: 4096\n# Valid for: 1y (renew yearly)\n# Enter name and email\n\n# List keys\ngpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long\n\n# Copy key ID (after sec rsa4096/)\n# Example: rsa4096/ABCD1234\n\n# Export public key\ngpg --armor --export ABCD1234\n\n# Add to GitHub: Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New GPG key\n\n# Configure Git to sign\ngit config --global user.signingkey ABCD1234\ngit config --global commit.gpgsign true\n\n# Sign commits\ngit commit -S -m \"Signed commit\"\n\n# Verify signature\ngit log --show-signature\n```\n\n## 3. Enable 2FA on GitHub\n\n1. Settings → Password and authentication\n2. Enable two-factor authentication\n3. Use authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy)\n4. Save recovery codes securely\n\n## 4. Review Dependencies\n\nWhen cloning repos:\n\n```bash\n# Check who owns the repo\n# Look at commit history\ngit log --all --format='%aN <%aE>' | sort -u\n\n# Check recent activity\ngit log --since=\"1 month ago\" --oneline\n\n# Review what you're about to run\ncat install.sh  # Before running!\n\n# Check for suspicious files\nfind . -name \"*.exe\" -o -name \"*.dll\" -o -name \"*.sh\"\n```\n\n## 5. Protect Main Branch\n\n**On GitHub:**\n1. Settings → Branches → Add rule\n2. Branch name pattern: `main`\n3. Enable:\n   - Require pull request reviews (at least 1)\n   - Require status checks\n   - Require signed commits\n   - Include administrators\n4. Save\n\nNow no one (including you) can push directly to main.\n\n## 6. Audit Repository Access\n\n```bash\n# View who has access (repo settings)\nSettings → Manage access\n\n# Review webhook configurations\nSettings → Webhooks\n\n# Check deploy keys\nSettings → Deploy keys\n\n# Monitor security alerts\nSecurity → Security advisories\n```\n\n## 7. Use Private Repositories for Sensitive Work\n\n- Security research\n- Internal tools\n- Client projects\n- Unpublished exploits\n- Red team infrastructure\n\n## 8. Regular Security Practices\n\n```bash\n# Keep Git updated\ngit --version\nsudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade git\n\n# Review .git/config for suspicious remotes\ncat .git/config\n\n# Check for hooks (can execute code)\nls -la .git/hooks/\n\n# Verify remote URLs\ngit remote -v\n```\n\n## 9. Malware Research Repositories\n\nSpecial considerations:\n\n```bash\n# Use .gitattributes to mark malware\ncat > .gitattributes << EOF\n*.exe binary\n*.dll binary\nmalware-samples/** binary\nEOF\n\n# Use Git LFS for large files\ngit lfs track \"*.exe\"\n\n# Add disclaimer to README\ncat >> README.md << EOF\n## WARNING\n\nThis repository contains malware samples for research purposes.\n\n**DO NOT RUN ON PRODUCTION SYSTEMS**\n\nAll samples are password-protected (password: infected)\nUse only in isolated environments.\nEOF\n```\n\n## 10. License Your Work\n\nAlways include a LICENSE file:\n\n```bash\n# Common licenses for security tools\n# MIT - Permissive\n# GPL-3.0 - Copyleft\n# Apache-2.0 - Permissive with patent grant\n\n# Add LICENSE file\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/licenses/license-templates/master/templates/mit.txt -O LICENSE\n\n# Commit it\ngit add LICENSE\ngit commit -m \"Add MIT license\"\n```"

Git as Audit Trail**\n- Every change documented (who, what, when, why)\n- Critical for incident response and compliance\n- Can prove timeline of actions\n\n**2. Branching for Safety**\n- Test detections without breaking production\n- Experiment with exploits safely\n- Roll back if something breaks\n\n**3. Collaboration at Scale**\n- Multiple team members working simultaneously\n- Code review improves quality\n- Knowledge sharing through commit messages\n\n**4. Version Control for IOCs**\n- Track how threats evolve\n- Document detection rule improvements\n- Share threat intelligence\n\n**5. Infrastructure as Code**\n- Red team infrastructure reproducible\n- Blue team defenses documented\n- Easier onboarding for new team members"
