Your smart doorbell, fitness tracker, and smart fridge are IoT devices. IoT security is like putting locks on all these smart devices so hackers can't control them.\n\n---\n\n# Deep Dive: Industrial IoT (IIoT) and SCADA Security\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### 1. Critical infrastructure threats\n\nThis concept covers essential aspects of iot security security. At an advanced level, you'll master complex implementations and handle sophisticated threat scenarios.\n\n### 2. ICS/SCADA protocols (Modbus\n\nThis concept covers essential aspects of iot security security. At an advanced level, you'll master complex implementations and handle sophisticated threat scenarios.\n\n### 3. DNP3)\n\nThis concept covers essential aspects of iot security security. At an advanced level, you'll master complex implementations and handle sophisticated threat scenarios.\n\n### 4. Real-world industrial attacks\n\nThis concept covers essential aspects of iot security security. At an advanced level, you'll master complex implementations and handle sophisticated threat scenarios.\n\n\n## Practical Application\n\nUnderstanding Industrial IoT (IIoT) and SCADA Security is critical for modern cybersecurity professionals. This knowledge directly applies to protecting iot security systems in production environments.\n\n"

It launched massive DDoS attacks that brought down major websites.\n\n**Attack Vector**: Automated scanning for IoT devices with default passwords (admin/admin, root/password).\n\n**Impact**: 1 Tbps DDoS attack - largest at the time.\n\n**Lessons Learned**: Change default credentials, disable unnecessary services, segment IoT devices on separate network."
