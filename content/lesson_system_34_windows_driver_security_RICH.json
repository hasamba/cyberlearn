We\ndescribe the responsibilities, metrics, and collaboration patterns each role brings to the mission.\n\nMeasurement guidance covers leading indicators (shift-left behaviors, automation coverage), lagging\nindicators (reduced dwell time, audit pass rates), and qualitative signals (confidence in\nbriefings).\n\nPitfall watchlist: we flag legacy habits, tooling myths, and communication gaps that frequently\nderail progress, pairing each with countermeasures.\n\nMomentum plan: document ownership, next experiments, and knowledge-sharing touchpoints so the\ncapability matures between sprints.\n\nContinuous improvement brief 1 for Windows Driver Security: capture lessons learned, convert them\ninto automation stories, socialize them with stakeholders, and schedule the next rehearsal so\nmomentum compounds.\n\nContinuous improvement brief 2 for Windows Driver Security: capture lessons learned, convert them\ninto automation stories, socialize them with stakeholders, and schedule the next rehearsal so\nmomentum compounds.\n\nContinuous improvement brief 3 for Windows Driver Security: capture lessons learned, convert them\ninto automation stories, socialize them with stakeholders, and schedule the next rehearsal so\nmomentum compounds.\n\nContinuous improvement brief 4 for Windows Driver Security: capture lessons learned, convert them\ninto automation stories, socialize them with stakeholders, and schedule the next rehearsal so\nmomentum compounds.\n\nMastery sustainment note 1: treat Windows Driver Security as a living program—broadcast wins,\ncapture obstacles, invest in automation, and schedule the next rehearsal so the learning cycle never\nstalls.\n\nMastery sustainment note 2: treat Windows Driver Security as a living program—broadcast wins,\ncapture obstacles, invest in automation, and schedule the next rehearsal so the learning cycle never\nstalls.\n\nMastery sustainment note 3: treat Windows Driver Security as a living program—broadcast wins,\ncapture obstacles, invest in automation, and schedule the next rehearsal so the learning cycle never\nstalls.\n\nMastery sustainment note 4: treat Windows Driver Security as a living program—broadcast wins,\ncapture obstacles, invest in automation, and schedule the next rehearsal so the learning cycle never\nstalls.\n\nMastery sustainment note 5: treat Windows Driver Security as a living program—broadcast wins,\ncapture obstacles, invest in automation, and schedule the next rehearsal so the learning cycle never\nstalls.\n\nMastery sustainment note 6: treat Windows Driver Security as a living program—broadcast wins,\ncapture obstacles, invest in automation, and schedule the next rehearsal so the learning cycle never\nstalls.\n\nMastery sustainment note 7: treat Windows Driver Security as a living program—broadcast wins,\ncapture obstacles, invest in automation, and schedule the next rehearsal so the learning cycle never\nstalls.\n\nMastery sustainment note 8: treat Windows Driver Security as a living program—broadcast wins,\ncapture obstacles, invest in automation, and schedule the next rehearsal so the learning cycle never\nstalls.\n\nMastery sustainment note 9: treat Windows Driver Security as a living program—broadcast wins,\ncapture obstacles, invest in automation, and schedule the next rehearsal so the learning cycle never\nstalls."
