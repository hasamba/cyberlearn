## Content Quality Standards

### ‚ùå BAD Content (What to Avoid)

```json
{
  "content": {
    "text": "This lesson covers Kerberoasting. You'll learn the fundamentals."
  },
  "simplified_explanation": "Think of Kerberoasting like Kerberoasting in everyday life...",
  "memory_aids": ["Remember: Kerberoasting"]
}
```

**Problems:**
- No actual information
- Circular analogy (X like X)
- Useless memory aid

### ‚úÖ GOOD Content (What to Create)

```json
{
  "content": {
    "text": "Kerberoasting exploits a weakness in how Windows Active Directory handles service accounts. When a service (like SQL Server) runs under a specific account, that account is assigned a Service Principal Name (SPN). Any authenticated user can request a Kerberos service ticket (TGS) for that SPN. The TGS is encrypted with the service account's password hash - and here's the vulnerability: you can extract that encrypted ticket and crack it OFFLINE.

Step-by-step attack:
1. Enumerate SPNs: setspn -T domain.com -Q */*
2. Request TGS tickets: Invoke-Kerberoast
3. Extract tickets to hashcat format
4. Crack offline with wordlists
5. Use compromised credentials

Why this works:
- Service accounts often have weak passwords
- TGS uses RC4 encryption (weak) by default
- Requesting TGS is legitimate - looks normal
- Cracking happens offline - undetectable

Defense:
- Use 25+ character passwords for service accounts
- Enable AES encryption
- Use Managed Service Accounts (gMSA)
- Monitor Event ID 4769 for unusual TGS requests"
  },
  "simplified_explanation": "Imagine service accounts are like spare keys hidden under doormats. Kerberoasting is finding those hiding spots, taking pictures of the keys, and going home to make copies at your leisure. The building doesn't know you took photos - you just walked by looking normal!",
  "memory_aids": [
    "Kerberoasting = Kerber-ROASTING (cooking/cracking passwords)",
    "SPN = Service Principal Name = Service's 'phone number' in AD",
    "Remember: Request TGS ‚Üí Extract ‚Üí Crack offline"
  ]
}
```

**Good because:**
- 250+ words of real technical content
- Actual analogy that teaches the concept
- Step-by-step procedures
- Tools and commands included
- Attack AND defense perspectives
- Real memory techniques

## Using with AI Assistants

Each generated lesson includes a `_PROMPT.txt` file with detailed instructions for AI content generation.

### With Claude/ChatGPT:

```
1. Open the generated _PROMPT.txt file
2. Copy the entire prompt
3. Paste into Claude/ChatGPT
4. Ask: "Generate the content blocks as specified"
5. AI generates rich, detailed content
6. Copy the generated content into your lesson JSON
7. Review and refine
```

### Example AI Prompt Usage:

```
You: [Paste content from lesson_kerberoasting_PROMPT.txt]

Claude: [Generates 2500+ words of detailed Kerberoasting content with:
- Technical explanations
- Step-by-step attack procedures
- Real-world analogies
- Memory aids
- Quiz questions
- Defense strategies]

You: [Copy generated content into lesson JSON]
```

## Batch Generation of All Remaining Lessons

To generate rich templates for all 42 remaining lessons:

```bash
# This creates templates for the top 10 most important lessons
python create_rich_lesson.py --batch generate_all_rich_lessons.json

# Creates 10 structured lesson templates in content/ directory
# Each with [CONTENT TO BE GENERATED] markers
# Each with a _PROMPT.txt guide for AI assistance
```

Then fill in content:
- **Option A**: Manually write content (30-60 min per lesson)
- **Option B**: Use AI with the generated prompts (5-10 min per lesson)
- **Option C**: Hybrid - AI generates, you refine (10-15 min per lesson)

## File Structure

After generation:

```
content/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lesson_red_team_04_social_engineering_advanced.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lesson_red_team_04_social_engineering_advanced_PROMPT.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lesson_pentest_05_sql_injection_basics.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lesson_pentest_05_sql_injection_basics_PROMPT.txt
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (more lessons)
```

### Lesson JSON Structure

```json
{
  "lesson_id": "uuid",
  "domain": "red_team",
  "title": "Social Engineering Advanced",
  "difficulty": 3,
  "content_blocks": [
    {
      "block_id": "uuid",

      "explanation": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Tips for Writing Rich Content

### 1. Start with "Why"
Begin each lesson explaining why this topic matters. Motivation drives learning.

### 2. Use the "Explain to a Friend" Test
If you can't explain it to a non-technical friend, your analogy isn't good enough.

### 3. Include Specific Examples
Not: "Attackers use social engineering"
But: "In 2016, attackers called a help desk pretending to be the CEO, reset the CEO's password using social engineering, and gained access to 10 million customer records"

### 4. Show, Don't Just Tell
Include:
- Commands and syntax
- Step-by-step procedures
- Screenshots or ASCII diagrams
- Real tool output

### 5. Balance Offensive and Defensive
For attack lessons, always include:
- How to perform the attack
- How to detect it
- How to prevent it
- Why defenders struggle with it

### 6. Test Your Memory Aids
Show the mnemonic to someone else. Do they remember it 5 minutes later? If not, improve it.

## Loading Lessons into Database

After creating rich content:

```bash
# Load all lessons (including new ones)
python load_all_lessons.py

# Check what's loaded
python check_database.py

# Reset user to see new lessons
python check_database.py reset yourusername

# Launch app
streamlit run app.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "JSON validation error"
**Solution**: Check your JSON syntax with `python -m json.tool lesson.json`

### Issue: "Lesson not appearing in app"
**Solution**:
1. Check lesson was loaded: `python check_database.py`
2. Check user's skill level matches lesson difficulty
3. Reset user: `python check_database.py reset yourusername`

### Issue: "Content blocks missing"
**Solution**: Ensure all [CONTENT TO BE GENERATED] markers are replaced with real content

## Advanced: Custom Lesson Types

You can extend the tool with custom lesson types:

```python
# In create_rich_lesson.py, add to LESSON_TEMPLATES:

"case_study": {
    "description": "Real-world breach analysis",
    "word_count": 2000,
    "focus": "Timeline, attack chain, lessons learned, prevention"
},

"hands_on_lab": {
    "description": "Practical lab exercise",
    "word_count": 1000,
    "focus": "Setup instructions, step-by-step tasks, verification"
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Generate templates** for your priority lessons
2. **Fill in rich content** (manually or with AI)
3. **Load into database** and test
4. **Get user feedback** on content quality
5. **Iterate and improve** based on feedback

## Questions?

- **How long to create one lesson?** 5-60 minutes depending on method (AI vs manual)
- **Can I edit generated lessons?** Yes! They're just JSON files
- **Can I create lessons in other languages?** Yes, just translate the content
- **Can I add custom fields?** Yes, but update Pydantic models too
