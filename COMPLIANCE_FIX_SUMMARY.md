## Remaining Issues (26 lessons)

The remaining 26 non-compliant lessons have issues that require manual review:

### Issue Breakdown:
- **6x** Content block 1 (explanation) contains placeholder text
- **3x** Too few Jim Kwik principles (<5)
- **3x** Content block 7 (real_world) contains placeholder text
- **2x** Content block 2 (explanation) contains placeholder text
- **2x** Too few content blocks (<4)
- **2x** Content block 6 (explanation) contains placeholder text
- **2x** Content block 3 (code_exercise) contains placeholder text
- **2x** Content block 4 (code_exercise) contains placeholder text
- **1x** Content block 0 (explanation) contains placeholder text
- **1x** Content block 4 (memory_aid) contains placeholder text

### Why Manual Review Needed:
1. **Placeholder text in specific blocks**: Some placeholders are embedded in otherwise good content and need careful editing
2. **Jim Kwik principles**: Need domain-specific principles that match lesson content
3. **Content blocks**: Need meaningful content blocks that enhance the lesson

## Files Modified

### First Run (65 files):
- Fixed assessment questions and placeholder text
- Mostly OSINT, Pentest, Blue Team, and DFIR lessons

### Second Run (53 files):
- Added missing fields to all assessment questions
- Ensured question_id, type, and difficulty present

## Scripts Used

1. **fix_compliance_issues.py** - Main automation script
   - Handles assessment questions
   - Removes placeholder text
   - Adds Jim Kwik principles
   - Adds content blocks

2. **validate_lesson_compliance.py** - Validation script
   - Checks all 411 lessons
   - Reports compliance issues
   - Generates detailed reports

## Next Steps

For the remaining 26 non-compliant lessons, manual review is recommended:

1. **For placeholder text**:
   - Review the content block context
   - Write appropriate technical content
   - Ensure it fits the lesson domain and difficulty

2. **For missing Jim Kwik principles**:
   - Review lesson content
   - Select relevant principles from the standard list
   - Ensure they enhance learning experience

3. **For missing content blocks**:
   - Add meaningful content blocks (quiz, reflection, memory_aid, etc.)
   - Ensure variety and pedagogical value

## Impact

- ✅ **118 issues resolved automatically**
- ✅ **56 more lessons now compliant**
- ✅ **93.7% of lessons meet quality standards**
- ⚠️ **26 lessons need manual content enhancement**
- 📊 **Warnings** (324 total) are recommendations, not blockers

## Conclusion

The automated fixes successfully addressed the majority of compliance issues. The platform now has a strong foundation of compliant lessons. The remaining issues are content-quality related and benefit from manual expert review rather than automated fixes.
