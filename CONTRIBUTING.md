## üìö Creating New Lessons

### Step 1: Copy Template
```bash
cp content/lesson_template.json content/your_lesson.json
```

### Step 2: Fill in Content

Use `content/sample_lesson_cia_triad.json` as a reference.

**Required elements:**
- Unique lesson_id (generate with `python -c "import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4())"`)
- Title and learning objectives
- 5-8 content blocks
- At least 5 quiz questions
- All 10 Jim Kwik principles represented

### Step 3: Quality Checklist

Before submitting, ensure your lesson has:

- [ ] Mindset coaching introduction
- [ ] Clear explanations with simplified (ELI10) versions
- [ ] Visual diagrams or ASCII art
- [ ] At least 3 memory aids (mnemonics/metaphors)
- [ ] Real-world connections for each major concept
- [ ] Interactive simulation or hands-on exercise
- [ ] Meta-learning reflection prompts
- [ ] 5-10 quiz questions with explanations
- [ ] Appropriate difficulty level
- [ ] Accurate estimated time (test with users)

### Step 4: Load and Test

```python
import json
from uuid import UUID
from utils.database import Database
from models.lesson import Lesson

db = Database()
with open('content/your_lesson.json', 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
data['lesson_id'] = UUID(data['lesson_id'])
data['prerequisites'] = [UUID(p) for p in data['prerequisites']]
lesson = Lesson(**data)
db.create_lesson(lesson)
db.close()
```

Then test in the application.

## üêõ Reporting Bugs

When reporting bugs, please include:

1. **Description**: Clear description of the issue
2. **Steps to Reproduce**: Exact steps to reproduce the bug
3. **Expected Behavior**: What should happen
4. **Actual Behavior**: What actually happens
5. **Environment**:
   - OS (Windows/Linux/Mac)
   - Python version
   - Browser (for UI issues)
6. **Screenshots**: If applicable
7. **Logs**: Error messages from terminal

## üíª Code Style Guidelines

### Python
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints (Pydantic models)
- Write docstrings for all functions/classes
- Keep functions focused and small (<50 lines)
- Use meaningful variable names

### Example:
```python
def calculate_xp(
    base_xp: int,
    score: int,
    time_spent: int,
    streak: int
) -> int:
    """
    Calculate XP earned with bonuses applied.

    Args:
        base_xp: Base XP for lesson
        score: Quiz score (0-100)
        time_spent: Time in seconds
        streak: Current streak days

    Returns:
        Total XP with all multipliers applied
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

### Documentation
- Use Markdown for all docs
- Include code examples
- Keep language clear and concise
- Use emojis for visual clarity (but not excessively)

## üîç Review Process

1. **Automated Checks**: Code must pass linting and tests
2. **Manual Review**: Maintainers review for quality and fit
3. **Testing**: Changes must be tested locally
4. **Documentation**: Updates to docs if needed
5. **Approval**: At least one maintainer approval required

## üìù Commit Message Guidelines

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
[Type] Short description

Longer explanation if needed

Examples:
- [Feature] Add video content support to lesson viewer
- [Fix] Correct XP calculation for streak bonus
- [Docs] Update QUICK_START with troubleshooting
- [Content] Add DFIR lesson on chain of custody
- [Refactor] Simplify adaptive engine recommendation logic
