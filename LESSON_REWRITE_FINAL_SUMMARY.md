## üîß Recommendations for Remaining Work

### High Priority (OSINT Domain - 70% compliance)
The OSINT domain needs the most work with 5 non-compliant lessons. These lessons require:
- Real-world OSINT investigation case studies
- Tool tutorials (Maltego, theHarvester, Shodan, Recon-ng)
- Memory aids for OSINT techniques
- Code exercises with actual OSINT workflows

### Medium Priority (Pentest & Red Team - 3-5 lessons each)
- Replace generic placeholder text with specific attack techniques
- Add real-world penetration testing examples
- Include tool commands and configurations

### Low Priority (Scattered lessons - 11 total)
- Most are single placeholder text issues in otherwise complete lessons
- Can be fixed with targeted 500-1,000 word additions
- Lower priority due to high existing content quality in these lessons

## üìÅ Files Committed

All changes have been committed to git in 3 commits:
1. **First commit**: Initial compliance fixes (assessment questions, Jim Kwik principles)
2. **Second commit**: 15 lesson rewrites
3. **Third commit**: 3 additional lesson rewrites (OSINT, Pentest, Red Team)

## üéâ Success Summary

**Before This Work:**
- 385/411 lessons compliant (93.7%)
