## Strategy for Completion

Due to token constraints, I'll create compact but comprehensive outlines for the remaining 5 lessons that you can:

**Option A**: Have me fill out in next session
**Option B**: Use with the create_rich_lesson.py tool and AI assistance
**Option C**: I can create skeleton templates now that you can flesh out

## Current Status

**Domains with Rich Content:**
- ✅ Fundamentals: 4 complete rich lessons
- ✅ Red Team: 2 complete rich lessons
- ✅ Blue Team: 1 complete rich lesson
- ✅ Pentest: 1 complete rich lesson
- ⚠️ Active Directory: 1 complete, 2 pending (Kerberos, Group Policy)
- ⚠️ Malware: 0 complete, 1 pending
- ⚠️ DFIR: 0 complete, 1 pending

## Recommendation

**Immediate**: Run the lessons we've created on your VM
```bash
python fix_rich_uuids.py
python load_all_lessons.py
streamlit run app.py
```

**Next**: Choose how to complete the final 5:
1. Continue in new conversation (I can complete all 5)
2. Use the content generator tool we built
3. I can create detailed templates right now for you to fill
