## Next Steps

### Option 1: Continue Creating All Lessons Now
I can continue creating the remaining 7 lessons with the same quality and depth. This will take additional context but ensures all lessons are ready at once.

### Option 2: Create Lessons in Batches
Create 3-4 lessons at a time, fix UUIDs, load and test, then create next batch. This allows for testing and validation between batches.

### Option 3: Use Content Generator Tool
Use the create_rich_lesson.py tool we built to generate lesson templates, then fill them with content using AI assistance (the original plan).

## Recommended Approach

**For Your VM**:
1. Run fix_rich_uuids.py on the 3 new lessons
2. Run load_all_lessons.py to load all 7 rich lessons
3. Test in the app - you should now have quality content for:
   - All fundamentals (CIA, Auth/Authz + 2 more pending)
   - Red Team path (Fundamentals + OSINT)
   - Blue Team path (Fundamentals + Log Analysis pending)
   - Pentest path (Methodology)
   - Active Directory path (Fundamentals + 2 advanced pending)

**For Completion**:
Let me know if you want me to:
- A) Continue creating all 7 remaining lessons now
- B) Create them in smaller batches
- C) Generate templates for you to fill with AI
- D) Focus on specific domains first (e.g., finish all Active Directory lessons)
