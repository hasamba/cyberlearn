# Migration Status Check

## How to Check if Migration Was Run

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
cd ~/cyberlearn
sqlite3 cyberlearn.db "PRAGMA table_info(users);" | grep -E "last_username|preferred_tag_filters"
```

**Expected Output if Migration WAS Run:**
```
14|last_username|TEXT|0||0
15|preferred_tag_filters|TEXT|0|'[]'|0
```

**Expected Output if Migration NOT Run:**
```
(no output - columns don't exist)
```

---

## If Migration NOT Run

Username and tag preferences will NOT persist across browser refreshes.

**To Enable Persistence:**
```bash
cd ~/cyberlearn
python add_ui_preferences.py
```

Then restart the app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Symptoms of Migration NOT Run

1. ✅ **App works normally** (backward compatible)
2. ❌ **Username not saved** - Must re-enter on each login
3. ❌ **Tag selections not saved** - Resets to default on browser refresh
4. ⚠️ **No errors** - App gracefully handles missing columns

   - **YES** → Migration was run ✅
   - **NO** → Migration not run ❌
